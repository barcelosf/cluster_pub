# ClusterPub

ClusterPub is a tool developed to help researchers in their processes of bibliographic review, 
helping them to find papers related to their areas of interest,
based on search results returned by paper repositories, like IEEE Xplore and Pubmed.

## Use Cases üìö

### Literature Review for Thesis
A graduate student needs to conduct a literature review on Artificial Intelligence for his final thesis. He performs a search on IEEE Xplore and exports the results in BibTeX format. With hundreds of articles, the manual process of filtering and organizing would be time-consuming.

Using the ClusterPub tool, he processes the BibTeX file in a few seconds, generating a dendrogram that groups the articles based on their similarities. This way, he can quickly identify which articles are most relevant to his research topic, optimizing the time spent selecting materials.

### Source Organization in Collaborative Research
A team of researchers working on an interdisciplinary project (involving mental health and neuroscience) collects articles from different repositories, such as IEEE Xplore and PubMed, exporting the files in different formats (BibTeX and NBIB). Each team member has different areas of focus, and the number of gathered articles is too large to be analyzed manually.

The ClusterPub tool is used to automatically group the articles by thematic similarity. The result, displayed as a dendrogram, helps the team identify subgroups of articles and determine which texts are priorities for each sub-area, facilitating the division of readings and the organization of collaborative research.

## Programming Language üíª

ClusterPub was developed using Python 3.11.

## Installation üõ†

It is possible to use ClusterPub as a standalone CLI, to do so install it with pip:

```bash Python installation command
pip install -U cluster-pub
```

But if you want to run the code by yourself, execute the following commands:

### Update Linux packages and install dependencies

First, update the Linux packages and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev
```

### Install pipx and Poetry

Next, install pipx and Poetry.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

### Install Python 3.11

Now, install Python 3.11 using the `pyenv` tool. If you don't have `pyenv` installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Then, install Python 3.11:

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.0
```

### Create a Python virtual environment

Create a new Python virtual environment using Poetry.

```bash
poetry env use 3.11
poetry shell
```

### Install project dependencies

Finally, install the project dependencies using Poetry.

```bash
poetry install
```

## Run ClusterPub üöÄ

To execute ClusterPub, run the following command:

```bash
cluster-pub {source_file} {result_file}
```

Note: The result_file name should contain the desired extension.

## Extract Clustering Metrics  üìà

OBS: The argument number_of_clusters does not specify the desired number of clusters, but it is the number of clusters/categories that might exit the analyzed dataset.

To calculate clustering metrics, like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Score, run the following commands:

```bash
cluster-pub-metrics davies-bouldin-score {source_file} {number_of_clusters}
cluster-pub-metrics calinski-harabasz-score {source_file} {number_of_clusters}
cluster-pub-metrics silhouette-score {source_file} {number_of_clusters} --distance-metric={distance_metric}
```

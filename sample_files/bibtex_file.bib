  abstract={312% Python is an alternative to ABC that provides an efficient high-level data architecture and handles object-oriented programming efficiently. The programming language of Python is usually relatively explicit and consistent, which makes the Python programming language easy to understand and easy to maintain. Python is a very common scripting language, especially suitable for software development in various languages. In this paper, Python software is used to numerically simulate the stress characteristic matrix method, and a set of characteristic matrix images for analyzing concrete structures is established. The purpose is to overcome the problems existing in the traditional convolutional neural network method in concrete. Through deep learning of image data, the results show that the simulated value generated by this software can well replace the actual value and achieve the expected purpose.},

  abstract={In the next decade, there is an enormous increase in job openings in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The early recognition of STEM talent is necessary to meet the demands of STEM labor force in the United States. Thus, it is essential for educators to apply diverse teaching methods to provide meaningful programming learning to students at High School level. In this study, the researchers designed an eight-session Python programming curriculum for high school girls and implemented in Girls in Engineering, Mathematics, Science (GEMS) STEAM program in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Through the analysis of pre- and post- surveys and interviews, the results showed that the Python programming course have created a fun and interesting learning environment. This eight-session course effectively expanded students' previous knowledge about programming and increase their interests in computer science (CS). In the process of learning, students developed the problem-solving skills. This study suggested that it is important for educators to create a fun and interactive learning environment when teaching programming for high school girls. There is a need of more efforts and opportunities which needs to be provided for girls to increase their participation in CS.},

  abstract={Computer programming is a skill that every information technology (IT) student must know and have. Computer programming is delivered using different programming languages. A programming language is a set of instructions to build computer programs. The College of Information and Communications Technology (CICT) of Bulacan State University (BulSU) offers different programming languages to its IT students from first- to fourth-year level. One of the languages students must take is Python programming. Python programming language is a scripting language used to develop web applications, data analytics, machine learning, and more. This study focuses on determining the students' programming competency in Python programming using a paired sample t-test. To deliver its objective, a concurrent triangulation design of mixed methods research was utilized to gather quantitative and qualitative data at the same time from fourth-year IT students of BulSU-CICT. Using paired sample ttests to calculate and interpret the quantitative data gathered, this study found that there is a significant difference between the before and after performance of the students in programming (P<0.00l), specifically in Python programming. Additionally, a manual analysis was delivered on the thoughts of the students upon completing the course. It is highlighted that students learned a lot, and their expectations were met after taking the course. From what this study discovered, course offerings of other programming languages may also be subjected to analyze the need for course syllabus revisions to fit what the student needs based on their performance and thoughts.},

  abstract={The Python programming language plays a large role in computer science today, both in industry and education. While the pseudo-code nature of its keywords and built-in functions/modules makes programming easy to learn for English speakers, non-English speakers do not have this advantage. Our goal is to further the democratization of computer science, allowing anyone to code in their native language, anywhere. This paper describes our vision for realizing this goal by automatically translating Python (keywords, error messages, identifiers) into other human languages, leveraging recent developments in machine translation and language technologies in general. As a first step, we introduce a preliminary multi-lingual Python tool that enables a user to code, translate, and execute Python in 5 additional languages, as well as a roadmap for the future development of our automated framework.},

  abstract={Due to its complexity and high dimensionality, power system analysis has always relied on numerical computation for real-time operation and planning. It is therefore of great importance that power systems engineering students have a robust understanding of computing and learn how to code. This paper discusses how Python can be an adequate programming language for education and research on power system analysis. This is accomplished by the analysis of a power transmission system from the perspectives of: (i) formation of bus admittance matrix, (ii) state estimation and (iii) fault studies. For each example, a simple vectorized Python 3 code, along with its basic concepts and functions highlighted, is presented. Additionally, the main results of interest are plotted to show the ability of Python in producing publication quality 2D and 3D plots.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper evaluates the effectiveness of flowcharting as a scaffolding tool to learn a programming language like Python in the setting of an urban institution that serves mostly underrepresented minority students. We found that the abilities of students to solve problems using flowcharts is a good predictor of their ability to solve problems with Python (r-squared = 0.68). This means that the majority of students who perform well using flowcharts will perform well in Python. A majority of students found flowcharting easier than Python (63%), and reported that flowcharting helped them understand how to write programs in Python (73%). However, flowcharting is not a magic bullet for learning programming because about 31% of students have difficulty solving problems with a flowcharting tool (and Python). We also found that the ability of students to read code is not highly correlated with their ability to write code in Python. In conclusion: 1) For a majority of students flowcharting is an effective scaffolding tool to learn Python; 2) The ability to read and trace code is not predictive of the ability of students to solve problems and write viable programs in Python.},

The considered examples cover the basic operations of the Python programming language and can be used in other programming languages. The problems of using other operations as logical ones are covered. The article also provides truth tables for all unary and binary Boolean functions and corresponding non-logical functions, as well as the generally accepted names of unary and binary Boolean functions and operations put together.},

Teachers play an important role in today's technology-rich classrooms that significantly affect students' learning. For this reason it is time for the students, taking up biology in senior school, to realize that their responsibilities towards the subject have changed, since recent trends in information and communication are redefining biology and taking precedence over the traditional methods. The present study is designed to investigate the utility of Python programming language as a teaching material for high school students in learning biology. This paper also highlights the strengths in using Python Language in some selected topics of biology and establishes how there is a connection between student successes in learning biology with creative use of Python programs.},

  year={2015},
  volume={},

  pages={225-226},
  abstract={Programming is a fundamental ability for Computer Science majors. Most programming lectures use traditional languages, such as C, C++, or Java, as the first learning language for novices, which are effective for designing real applications and therefore are popular in industry. However, the complex syntax of these languages is challenging for novices, which becomes an obstacle to novices' learning. Python has simpler syntax and high-level data structures to enable succinct programs. The multiple paradigms of Python also provide learners opportunities to learn various features of programming languages. Therefore, Python gradually becomes a new option of the first language for learning. This study investigates the features of the first learning programming language by comparing Python with the popular learning language Java. A questionnaire study will be conducted on both instructors and students to understand how the features of languages affect students' learning from the aspects of program translation and execution (interpretation vs. Compilation), variable declaration (dynamic vs. Static), the syntax of control structures, and the object-oriented syntaxes. For each aspect of questionnaire, questions are designed to understand whether and how the language features in this aspect influence program comprehension (including the occurrence of misconceptions or errors, and cognitive load) and program implementation. The research results will give instructors suggestions for selecting suitable learning languages in their lectures and designing adaptive instructional strategies/materials based on the features of the selected language.},

  abstract={In the future, it is expected that the demand for people with programming abilities will increase. Programming has become an ability that everyone needs to have, and it is also a part of the global basic curriculum. However, programming is difficult for junior high school students, so more study is needed to solve this problem. This study proposes programming learning methods based on the scaffolding theory based on different flowchart scaffoldings (gap-filling flowchart scaffolding, multiple-choice flowchart scaffolding) to cultivate students' programming abilities. Therefore, a Python course was designed and implemented in a middle school to explore the influence of students' programming abilities. During the 6-week teaching practice, a total of 96 students in two parallel classes were tested for programming abilities, and qualitative interviews were conducted with the students. The results show that (1) the gap-filling flowchart scaffolding is beneficial to improve students' programming comprehensive performance; (2) especially the improvement of programming skills is more significant.},

  abstract={Reform of teaching content, teaching methods and evaluation of examination system is an urgent issue of current teaching reform in higher education. The article discusses how to reform and optimize the teaching methods of Python language programming course based on visualization; students can change the learning method under the guidance of teachers, promote selfexploration, and form a proactive and personalized learning habit. The paper proposes the establishment of “visualization teaching mode”. By dynamically adjust the curriculum, scientifically plan teaching contents and efficiently use of the different teaching cases, teaching can better comply with the law of high education's development, and then effectively improve the quality of teaching and promote the development of higher education.},

  abstract={The transition from one programming language to another is an issue, which usually needs to be addressed in programming curricula, as the learning is typically started with syntactically easier languages. This study explores the possibility to use a short interactive tutorial with visualization exercises to ease the transition from Python to Java. In the experiment, the students first took a pre-test to measure their earlier programming knowledge with Python. After that, they used the tutorial with visualization exercises for 45 minutes. The tutorial and the exercises were designed to underline the syntactical and structural differences between Python and Java. Finally, the students answered to post-test, which contained questions similar to pre-test, but in Java. The results indicate, that the students were able to obtain similar program comprehension skills in Java that they previously had with Python. Moreover, the students seem to think that using such tutorials is highly beneficial in the transition. Hence, we conclude, that ViLLE can be effectively used to ease the transition from one language to another.},

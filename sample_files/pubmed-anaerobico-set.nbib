AB  - Microbial methane oxidation is an important process to reduce the emission of the 
      greenhouse gas methane. Anaerobic microorganisms couple the oxidation of methane 
      to the reduction of sulfate, nitrate and nitrite, and possibly oxidized iron and 
      manganese minerals. In this article, we review the recent finding of the 
      intriguing nitrate- and nitrite-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 
      Nitrate-dependent AOM is catalyzed by anaerobic archaea belonging to the ANME-2d 
      clade closely related to Methanosarcina methanogens. They were named 'Candidatus 
      Methanoperedens nitroreducens' and use reverse methanogenesis with the key enzyme 
      methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-CoM) reductase for methane activation. Their major end 
      product is nitrite which can be taken up by nitrite-dependent methanotrophs. 
      Nitrite-dependent AOM is performed by the NC10 bacterium 'Candidatus 
      Methylomirabilis oxyfera' that probably utilizes an intra-aerobic pathway through 
      the dismutation of NO to N(2) and O(2) for aerobic methane activation by methane 
      monooxygenase, yet being a strictly anaerobic microbe. Environmental 
      distribution, physiological and biochemical aspects are discussed in this article 
      as well as the cooperation of the microorganisms involved.

AB  - Fe(III) has been recognized as a potential electron sink for the anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane (Fe-AOM) in diverse environments. However, most of previous 
      Fe-AOM processes are limited to ANME archaea and the Fe-AOM mechanism remains 
      unclear. Here we investigate, for the first time, the Fe-AOM performance and 
      mechanisms by a single methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri. The results showed that 
      M. barkeri was capable of oxidizing methane to CO(2) and reducing ferrihydrite to 
      siderite simultaneously. The presence of methane enhanced both the abundances of 
      redox-active species (such as cytochromes) and electrochemical activity of M. 
      barkeri. The proteomic analyses revealed that M. barkeri up-regulated the 
      expressions of a number of methanogenic enzymes during Fe-AOM, and significantly 
      enriched metabolic pathways of amino acid synthesis and nitrogen fixation. 
      Metabolic inhibition experiments indicated that membrane-bound redox-active 
      components (cytochromes, methanophenazine and F(420)H(2):quinone oxidoreductase) 
      were probably involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) from cells to 
      ferrihydrite. Overall, these results provide a deep insight into the 
      single‑carbon metabolism and survival strategy for methanogens and suggest that 
      methanogens may play an important role in linking methane and iron cycling in the 
      substrate-limited environments.

TI  - Active anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfur disproportionation in the deep 
      terrestrial subsurface.
PG  - 1583-1593

AB  - Microbial life is widespread in the terrestrial subsurface and present down to 
      several kilometers depth, but the energy sources that fuel metabolism in deep 
      oligotrophic and anoxic environments remain unclear. In the deep crystalline 
      bedrock of the Fennoscandian Shield at Olkiluoto, Finland, opposing gradients of 
      abiotic methane and ancient seawater-derived sulfate create a terrestrial 
      sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). We used chemical and isotopic data 
      coupled to genome-resolved metaproteogenomics to demonstrate active life and, for 
      the first time, provide direct evidence of active anaerobic oxidation of methane 
      (AOM) in a deep terrestrial bedrock. Proteins from Methanoperedens (formerly 
      ANME-2d) are readily identifiable despite the low abundance (≤1%) of this genus 
      and confirm the occurrence of AOM. This finding is supported by (13)C-depleted 
      dissolved inorganic carbon. Proteins from Desulfocapsaceae and 
      Desulfurivibrionaceae, in addition to (34)S-enriched sulfate, suggest that these 
      organisms use inorganic sulfur compounds as both electron donor and acceptor. 
      Zerovalent sulfur in the groundwater may derive from abiotic rock interactions, 
      or from a non-obligate syntrophy with Methanoperedens, potentially linking 
      methane and sulfur cycles in Olkiluoto groundwater. Finally, putative 
      episymbionts from the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) and DPANN archaea 
      represented a significant diversity in the groundwater (26/84 genomes) with roles 
      in sulfur and carbon cycling. Our results highlight AOM and sulfur 
      disproportionation as active metabolisms and show that methane and sulfur fuel 
      microbial activity in the deep terrestrial subsurface.

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is crucial for controlling the emission of 
      this potent greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Nitrite-, nitrate-, and 
      sulfate-dependent methane oxidation is well-documented, but AOM coupled to the 
      reduction of oxidized metals has so far been demonstrated only in environmental 
      samples. Here, using a freshwater enrichment culture, we show that archaea of the 
      order Methanosarcinales, related to "Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens," 
      couple the reduction of environmentally relevant forms of Fe(3+) and Mn(4+) to 
      the oxidation of methane. We obtained an enrichment culture of these archaea 
      under anaerobic, nitrate-reducing conditions with a continuous supply of methane. 
      Via batch incubations using [(13)C]methane, we demonstrated that soluble ferric 
      iron (Fe(3+), as Fe-citrate) and nanoparticulate forms of Fe(3+) and Mn(4+) 
      supported methane-oxidizing activity. CO(2) and ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) were 
      produced in stoichiometric amounts. Our study connects the previous finding of 
      iron-dependent AOM to microorganisms detected in numerous habitats worldwide. 
      Consequently, it enables a better understanding of the interaction between the 
      biogeochemical cycles of iron and methane.

      Methanoperedenaceae.
PG  - 1030-1041

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a major biological process that reduces 
      global methane emission to the atmosphere. Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea 
      (ANME) mediate this process through the coupling of methane oxidation to 
      different electron acceptors, or in concert with a syntrophic bacterial partner. 
      Recently, ANME belonging to the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly 
      known as ANME-2d) were shown to be capable of AOM coupled to nitrate and iron 
      reduction. Here, a freshwater sediment bioreactor fed with methane and Mn(IV) 
      oxides (birnessite) resulted in a microbial community dominated by two novel 
      members of the Methanoperedenaceae, with biochemical profiling of the system 
      demonstrating Mn(IV)-dependent AOM. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed 
      the expression of key genes involved in methane oxidation and several shared 
      multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) that were differentially expressed, 
      indicating the likely use of different extracellular electron transfer pathways. 
      We propose the names "Candidatus Methanoperedens manganicus" and "Candidatus 
      Methanoperedens manganireducens" for the two newly described Methanoperedenaceae 
      species. This study demonstrates the ability of members of the 
      Methanoperedenaceae to couple AOM to the reduction of Mn(IV) oxides, which 
      suggests their potential role in linking methane and manganese cycling in the 
      environment.

AB  - Consumption of methane by aerobic and anaerobic microbes governs the atmospheric 
      level of this powerful greenhouse gas. Whereas a biochemical understanding of 
      aerobic methanotrophy is well developed, a mechanistic understanding of anaerobic 
      methanotrophy has been prevented by the unavailability of pure cultures. Here we 
      report a biochemical investigation of Methanosarcina acetivorans, a 
      methane-producing species capable of anaerobic methanotrophic growth dependent on 
      reduction of Fe(III). Our findings support a pathway anchored by 
      Fe(III)-dependent mechanisms for energy conservation driving endergonic reactions 
      that are key to methanotrophic growth. The pathway is remarkably similar to 
      pathways hypothesized for uncultured anaerobic methanotrophic archaea. The 
      results contribute to an improved understanding of the methane cycle that is 
      paramount to understanding human interventions influencing Earth's climate. 
      Finally, the pathway enables advanced development and optimization of 
      biotechnologies converting methane to value-added products through metabolic 
      engineering of M. acetivorans.

AB  - Microbes play a crucial role in mediating the methane flux in deep-sea cold seep 
      ecosystems, where only methane-related microbes have been well studied, while the 
      whole microbial community and their ecological functions were still largely 
      unknown. Here, we utilized metagenomic data to investigate how the structure and 
      metabolism of microbial community shift in the reduced sediment habitats along 
      the spatial scales. Microbial communities in cold seeps and troughs formed two 
      distinct clades likely driven by environmental factors, such as total sulfur, 
      total phosphate and NO(3)(-), rather than geographical proximity. The 
      predominance of Methanosarcinales reflected a high potential for methane 
      production. In addition to the already well-reported ANME-1/SRB consortia, 
      prevalence of bacterial Methylomirabilis and archaeal Methanoperedens as 
      important performers in the n-damo process with respective of nitrite and nitrate 
      as respective electron acceptor was observed in deep-sea hydrate-bearing regions 
      as well. Aerobic methane oxidization was conducted mainly by type I methanotrophs 
      at Site F (Formosa Ridge), but also via the n-damo process by Methanoperedens and 
      Methylomirabilis in the Haima seep and Xisha Trough, respectively. Based on the 
      high abundance of those denitrifying-dependent methane oxidizers and their 
      related functional genes, we concluded that the previously overlooked n-damo 
      process might be a major methane sink in cold seeps or in gas hydrate-bearing 
      sediments if nitrate is available in the anoxic zones. The signature of isotopic 
      labeling would be essential to confirm the contribution of different anaerobic 
      methane oxidizing pathways in deep-sea cold seep ecosystems.

      reduction.

AB  - Microbially mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is a key process in the 
      regulation of methane emissions to the atmosphere. Iron can serve as an electron 
      acceptor for AOM, and it has been suggested that Fe(III)-dependent AOM 
      potentially comprises a major global methane sink. Although it has been proposed 
      that anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea can facilitate this process, their 
      active metabolic pathways have not been confirmed. Here we report the enrichment 
      and characterisation of a novel archaeon in a laboratory-scale bioreactor fed 
      with Fe(III) oxide (ferrihydrite) and methane. Long-term performance data, in 
      conjunction with the (13)C- and (57)Fe-labelling batch experiments, demonstrated 
      that AOM was coupled to Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) in this bioreactor. 
      Metagenomic analysis showed that this archaeon belongs to a novel genus within 
      family Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae, and possesses genes encoding the "reverse 
      methanogenesis" pathway, as well as multi-heme c-type cytochromes which are 
      hypothesised to facilitate dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction. Metatranscriptomic 
      analysis revealed upregulation of these genes, supporting that this archaeon can 
      independently mediate AOM using Fe(III) as the terminal electron acceptor. We 
      propose the name Candidatus "Methanoperedens ferrireducens" for this 
      microorganism. The potential role of "M. ferrireducens" in linking the carbon and 
      iron cycles in environments rich in methane and iron should be investigated in 
      future research.

      iron, and identified microorganisms involved across contrasting riverbeds. AOM 
      activity was confined to the more reduced, sandy riverbeds, whereas no activity 
      was measured in the less reduced, gravel riverbeds where there were few anaerobic 
      methanotrophs. Nitrite-dependent and nitrate-dependent AOM occurred in all sandy 
      riverbeds, with the maximum rates of 61.0 and 20.0 nmol CO(2) g(-1) (dry 
      sediment) d(-)(1), respectively, while sulfate-dependent and ferric 
      iron-dependent AOM occurred only where methane concentration was highest and the 
      diversity of AOM pathways greatest. Diverse Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera 
      (M. oxyfera)-like bacteria and Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens (M. 
      nitroreducens)-like archaea were detected in the sandy riverbeds (16S rRNA gene 
      abundance of 9.3 × 10(5) to 1.5 × 10(7) and 2.1 × 10(4) to 2.5 × 10(5) copies 
      g(-)(1) dry sediment, respectively) but no other known anaerobic methanotrophs. 
      Further, we found M. oxyfera-like bacteria and M. nitroreducens-like archaea to 
      be actively involved in nitrite- and nitrate/ferric iron-dependent AOM, 
      respectively. Hence, we demonstrate multiple pathways of AOM in relation to 
      methane, though the activities of M. oxyfera-like bacteria and M. 
      nitroreducens-like archaea are dominant.

AB  - Anaerobic sludge from a sewage treatment plant was used to acclimatize microbial 
      colonies capable of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate 
      reduction. Clone libraries and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to 
      investigate the microbial population. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (e.g., 
      Desulfotomaculum arcticum and Desulfobulbus propionicus) and anaerobic 
      methanotrophic archaea (ANME) (e.g., Methanosaeta sp. and Methanolinea sp.) 
      coexisted in the enrichment. The archaeal and bacterial cells were randomly or 
      evenly distributed throughout the consortia. Accompanied by sulfate reduction, 
      methane was oxidized anaerobically by the consortia of methane-oxidizing archaea 
      and SRB. Moreover, CH(4) and SO(4)(2-) were consumed by methanotrophs and sulfate 
      reducers with CO(2) and H(2)S as products. The H(3)CSH produced by methanotrophy 
      was an intermediate product during the process. The methanotrophic enrichment was 
      inoculated in a down-flow biofilter for the treatment of methane and H(2)S from a 
      landfill site. On average, 93.33% of H(2)S and 10.71% of methane was successfully 
      reduced in the biofilter. This study tries to provide effective method for the 
      synergistic treatment of waste gas containing sulfur compounds and CH(4).

TI  - Catalytic mechanism of butane anaerobic oxidation for alkyl-coenzyme M reductase.
PG  - 701-712
LID - 10.1111/cbdd.13931 [doi]
AB  - Methane is among the most potent of the greenhouse gases, which plays a key role 
      in global climate change. As an excellent carbon and energy source, methane can 
      be utilized by anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea and aerobic methane oxidizing 
      bacteria. The previous work shows that an anaerobic thermophilic enrichment 
      culture composed of dense consortia of archaea and bacteria apparently uses 
      partly similar pathways to oxidize the C4 hydrocarbon butane. However, the 
      catalytic mechanism of butane anaerobic oxidation for alkyl-coenzyme M reductase 
      is still unknown. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to 
      investigate the dynamics differences of catalytic mechanism between methane 
      coenzyme M reductase (MCR) and alkyl-coenzyme M reductase (ACR). At first, the 
      binding pocket of ACR is larger than that of MCR. Then, the complex of butane and 
      ACR is more stable than that of methane and ACR. Protein conformation cloud 
      suggests that the position of methane is dynamics and methane escapes from the 
      binding pocket of ACR during most of the simulation time, while butane tightly 
      binds in the pocket of ACR. The hydrophobic interactions between butane and ACR 
      are more and stronger than those between methane and ACR. At the same time, the 
      binding free energy between butane and ACR is significantly lower than that 
      between methane and ACR. The dynamics correlation network indicates that the 
      transformation of information flow for ACR-butane is smoother than that for 
      ACR-methane. The shortest pathway for ACR-butane is from Gln144, Ala141, Hie135, 
      Ile133, Ala160, Arg206, Asp97, Met94, Tyr347 to Phe345 with synergistic effect 
      for two butane molecules. This study can insight into the catalytic mechanism for 
      butane/ACR complex.

AB  - In anaerobic landfill, SO(4)(2-) could serve as electron receptor for methane 
      oxidation. In theory, concentrations of both methane and SO(4)(2-) should be 
      related to methane oxidation rate. However, the dynamics process has yet to be 
      discovered, and the understanding of metabolic pathways of the sulfate-dependent 
      anaerobic methane oxidation (S-DAMO) process in landfill remains limited. In this 
      study, S-DAMO dynamics was investigated by observing the CH(4) oxidation rates 
      under different CH(4)/ SO(4)(2-)counter-gradients. The CH(4)-SO(4)(2-) 
      dual-substrate model based on MichaeliseMenten equation was got (maximum 
      substrate degradation rate V(max) [22.9 ± 1.31] µmol/[kg·d], half-saturation 
      constants [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] ). High-throughput 
      sequencing analysis indicated Methanobacterials, Methanosarcinales, and Soil 
      Crenarchaeotic were the main functional microorganisms for S-DAMO in landfill. 
      The metabolic pathway of S-DAMO was speculated as the reverse methanogenesis 
      pathway through Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of 
      Unobserved States (PICRUST) analysis, while methanogenesis was the methyl 
      nutrition way based on methanol. The enzymes related to the carbon and sulfur 
      cycles and their relative abundances in the microcosms were analyzed to graph the 
      methane metabolic pathway and the sulfur metabolic pathway. The findings provide 
      important parameters for CH(4) mitigation in landfills, and give a new insight 
      for understanding S-DAMO metabolic pathway in landfill.

TI  - Artificial electron acceptors decouple archaeal methane oxidation from sulfate 
      reduction.
PG  - 703-7
LID - 10.1126/science.aad7154 [doi]
AB  - The oxidation of methane with sulfate is an important microbial metabolism in the 
      global carbon cycle. In marine methane seeps, this process is mediated by 
      consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that live in syntrophy with 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The underlying interdependencies within this 
      uncultured symbiotic partnership are poorly understood. We used a combination of 
      rate measurements and single-cell stable isotope probing to demonstrate that ANME 
      in deep-sea sediments can be catabolically and anabolically decoupled from their 
      syntrophic SRB partners using soluble artificial oxidants. The ANME still sustain 
      high rates of methane oxidation in the absence of sulfate as the terminal 
      oxidant, lending support to the hypothesis that interspecies extracellular 
      electron transfer is the syntrophic mechanism for the anaerobic oxidation of 
      methane.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaerobic digestion, whose final products are methane and carbon 
      dioxide, ensures energy flow and circulation of matter in ecosystems. This 
      naturally occurring process is used for the production of renewable energy from 
      biomass. Lactate, a common product of acidic fermentation, is a key intermediate 
      in anaerobic digestion of biomass in the environment and biogas plants. Effective 
      utilization of lactate has been observed in many experimental approaches used to 
      study anaerobic digestion. Interestingly, anaerobic lactate oxidation and lactate 
      oxidizers as a physiological group in methane-yielding microbial communities have 
      not received enough attention in the context of the acetogenic step of anaerobic 
      digestion. This study focuses on metabolic transformation of lactate during the 
      acetogenic and methanogenic steps of anaerobic digestion in methane-yielding 
      bioreactors. RESULTS: Methane-yielding microbial communities instead of pure 
      cultures of acetate producers were used to process artificial lactate-rich media 
      to methane and carbon dioxide in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. The 
      media imitated the mixture of acidic products found in anaerobic 
      environments/digesters where lactate fermentation dominates in acidogenesis. 
      Effective utilization of lactate and biogas production was observed. 16S rRNA 
      profiling was used to examine the selected methane-yielding communities. Among 
      Archaea present in the bioreactors, the order Methanosarcinales predominated. The 
      acetoclastic pathway of methane formation was further confirmed by analysis of 
      the stable carbon isotope composition of methane and carbon dioxide. The domain 
      Bacteria was represented by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, 
      Synergistetes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, Caldithrix, 
      Verrucomicrobia, Thermotogae, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Cyanobacteria. 
      Available genome sequences of species and/or genera identified in the microbial 
      communities were searched for genes encoding the lactate-oxidizing metabolic 
      machinery homologous to those of Acetobacterium woodii and Desulfovibrio 
      vulgaris. Furthermore, genes for enzymes of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway were 
      present in the microbial communities. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that 
      lactate is oxidized mainly to acetate during the acetogenic step of AD and this 
      comprises the acetotrophic pathway of methanogenesis. The genes for lactate 
      utilization under anaerobic conditions are widespread in the domain Bacteria. 
      Lactate oxidation to the substrates for methanogens is the most energetically 
      attractive process in comparison to butyrate, propionate, or ethanol oxidation.

TI  - Methyl-coenzyme M reductase and the anaerobic oxidation of methane in 
      methanotrophic Archaea.
PG  - 643-8
AB  - Recent biochemical and metagenomic data indicate that not yet cultured Archaea 
      that are closely related to methanogenic Archaea of the order of 
      Methanosarcinales are involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine 
      sediments. The DNA from the methanotrophic Archaea has been shown to harbor gene 
      homologues for methyl-coenzyme M reductase, which in methanogenic Archaea 
      catalyses the methane-forming reaction. In microbial mats catalyzing anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane, this nickel enzyme has been shown to be present in 
      concentrations of up to 10% of the total extracted proteins.

TI  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane at different temperature regimes in Guaymas Basin 
      hydrothermal sediments.
PG  - 1018-31
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2011.164 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) was investigated in hydrothermal sediments 
      of Guaymas Basin based on δ(13)C signatures of CH(4), dissolved inorganic carbon 
      and porewater concentration profiles of CH(4) and sulfate. Cool, warm and hot 
      in-situ temperature regimes (15-20 °C, 30-35 °C and 70-95 °C) were selected from 
      hydrothermal locations in Guaymas Basin to compare AOM geochemistry and 16S 
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA), mcrA and dsrAB genes of the microbial communities. 16S rRNA 
      gene clone libraries from the cool and hot AOM cores yielded similar archaeal 
      types such as Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group, Thermoproteales and anaerobic 
      methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME)-1; some of the ANME-1 archaea formed a separate 
      16S rRNA lineage that at present seems to be limited to Guaymas Basin. Congruent 
      results were obtained by mcrA gene analysis. The warm AOM core, chemically 
      distinct by lower porewater sulfide concentrations, hosted a different archaeal 
      community dominated by the two deep subsurface archaeal lineages Marine Benthic 
      Group D and Marine Benthic Group B, and by members of the Methanosarcinales 
      including ANME-2 archaea. This distinct composition of the methane-cycling 
      archaeal community in the warm AOM core was confirmed by mcrA gene analysis. 
      Functional genes of sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea, dsrAB, showed more 
      overlap between all cores, regardless of the core temperature. 16S rRNA gene 
      clone libraries with Euryarchaeota-specific primers detected members of the 
      Archaeoglobus clade in the cool and hot cores. A V6-tag high-throughput 
      sequencing survey generally supported the clone library results while providing 
      high-resolution detail on archaeal and bacterial community structure. These 
      results indicate that AOM and the responsible archaeal communities persist over a 
      wide temperature range.

AB  - A specially designed CH(4)-based membrane biofilm batch reactor (MBBR) was 
      applied to investigate anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to perchlorate 
      reduction (AnMO-PR). The 0.21 mM ClO(4)(-) added in the first stage of operation 
      was completely reduced in 28 days, 0.40 mM ClO(4)(-) was reduced within 23 days 
      in stage 2, and 0.56 mM of ClO(4)(-) was reduced within 30 days in stage 3. 
      Although some chlorate (ClO(3)(-)) accumulated, the recovery of Cl(-) was over 
      92%. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene documented that the bacterial 
      community was mainly composed by perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB), 
      methanotrophic bacteria, and archaea. Real-time quantitative PCR showed the 
      archaeal 16S rRNA and mcrA genes increased as more ClO(4)(-) was reduced, and the 
      predominant archaea belonged to Methanosarcina mazei, which is related to ANME-3, 
      an archaeon able to perform reverse methanogenesis. Several pieces of evidence 
      support that ClO(4)(-) reduction by the MBBR biofilm occurred via a synergism 
      between Methanosarcina and PRB: Methanosarcina oxidized methane through reverse 
      methanogesis and provided electron donor for PRB to reduce ClO(4)(-). Because 
      methanotrophs were present, we cannot rule out that they also were involved in 
      AnMO-PR if they received O(2) generated by disproportionation of ClO(2)(-) from 
      the PRB.

TI  - Illumina sequencing-based analysis of a microbial community enriched under

AB  - Methane is produced in anaerobic environments, such as reactors used to treat 
      wastewaters, and can be consumed by methanotrophs. The composition and structure 
      of a microbial community enriched from anaerobic sewage sludge under 
      methane-oxidation condition coupled to denitrification were investigated. 
      Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis retrieved sequences of 
      Methylocaldum and Chloroflexi. Deep sequencing analysis revealed a complex 
      community that changed over time and was affected by methane concentration. 
      Methylocaldum (8.2%), Methylosinus (2.3%), Methylomonas (0.02%), 
      Methylacidiphilales (0.45%), Nitrospirales (0.18%), and Methanosarcinales (0.3%) 
      were detected. Despite denitrifying conditions provided, Nitrospirales and 
      Methanosarcinales, known to perform anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to 
      denitrification (DAMO) process, were in very low abundance. Results demonstrated 
      that aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs coexisted in the reactor together with 
      heterotrophic microorganisms, suggesting that a diverse microbial community was 
      important to sustain methanotrophic activity. The methanogenic sludge was a good 
      inoculum to enrich methanotrophs, and cultivation conditions play a selective 
      role in determining community composition.

TI  - Syntrophic acetate oxidation in two-phase (acid-methane) anaerobic digesters.
PG  - 1812-20
LID - 10.2166/wst.2011.748 [doi]
AB  - The microbial processes involved in two-phase anaerobic digestion were 
      investigated by operating a laboratory-scale acid-phase (AP) reactor and 
      analyzing two full-scale, two-phase anaerobic digesters operated under mesophilic 
      (35 °C) conditions. The digesters received a blend of primary sludge and waste 
      activated sludge (WAS). Methane levels of 20% in the laboratory-scale reactor 
      indicated the presence of methanogenic activity in the AP. A phylogenetic 
      analysis of an archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone library of one of the full-scale AP 
      digesters showed that 82% and 5% of the clones were affiliated with the orders 
      Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales, respectively. These results indicate 
      that substantial levels of aceticlastic methanogens (order Methanosarcinales) 
      were not maintained at the low solids retention times and acidic conditions (pH 
      5.2-5.5) of the AP, and that methanogenesis was carried out by hydrogen-utilizing 
      methanogens of the order Methanobacteriales. Approximately 43, 31, and 9% of the 
      archaeal clones from the methanogenic phase (MP) digester were affiliated with 
      the orders Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanobacteriales, 
      respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of a bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library 
      suggested the presence of acetate-oxidizing bacteria (close relatives of 
      Thermacetogenium phaeum, 'Syntrophaceticus schinkii,' and Clostridium ultunense). 
      The high abundance of hydrogen consuming methanogens and the presence of known 
      acetate-oxidizing bacteria suggest that acetate utilization by acetate oxidizing 
      bacteria in syntrophic interaction with hydrogen-utilizing methanogens was an 
      important pathway in the second-stage of the two-phase digestion, which was 
      operated at high ammonium-N concentrations (1.0 and 1.4 g/L). A modified version 
      of the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) with extensions for syntrophic 
      acetate oxidation and weak-acid inhibition adequately described the dynamic 
      profiles of volatile acid production/degradation and methane generation observed 
      in the laboratory-scale AP reactor. The model was validated with historical data 
      from the full-scale digesters.

LID - 10.1126/science.1169984 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic methanotrophs help regulate Earth's climate and may have been an 
      important part of the microbial ecosystem on the early Earth. The anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane (AOM) is often thought of as a sulfate-dependent process, 
      despite the fact that other electron acceptors are more energetically favorable. 
      Here, we show that microorganisms from marine methane-seep sediment in the Eel 
      River Basin in California are capable of using manganese (birnessite) and iron 
      (ferrihydrite) to oxidize methane, revealing that marine AOM is coupled, either 
      directly or indirectly, to a larger variety of oxidants than previously thought. 
      Large amounts of manganese and iron are provided to oceans from rivers, 
      indicating that manganese- and iron-dependent AOM have the potential to be 
      globally important.

AB  - Methane oxidation coupled with denitrification is an effective way to reduce the 
      discharge of nitrate and methane. The anaerobic sludge from a laboratory 
      wastewater treatment facility, anaerobic sludge from a wastewater treatment 
      plant, and soil from a landfill were selected as inoculum to enrich the 
      consortium for anaerobic methane oxidation in cooperation with nitrate reduction. 
      The investigation of methane oxidation was carried out in these systems. The 
      results showed that the maximum methane consumption rate of 0.05 mg·d(-1) was 
      obtained when the anaerobic sludge from a wastewater treatment plant served as 
      inoculum. The population of bacteria and archaea were assayed by the clone 
      library method. The Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales were present in 
      methane oxidation as methane oxidizing archea. The Pseudomonas, Clostridia, and 
      Thermomonas were identified as nitrate reducing bacteria in the process of 
      nitrate reduction. Both the methane conversion rate and microbial population 
      varied with the amount of nitrate. The nitrate reduction bacteria were 
      Pseudomonas and Clostridia when the nitrate concentration was 200 mg·L(-1). The 
      Pseudomonas and Thermomonas emerged when the nitrate concentration increased to 
      500 mg·L(-1), and the rate of methane conversion was increased by 34.7%. The 
      results provided science evidence for the co-treatment of methane and nitrate.

TI  - Ecological and genomic profiling of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea in a deep 
      granitic environment.
PG  - 31-47
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2017.140 [doi]
AB  - Recent single-gene-based surveys of deep continental aquifers demonstrated the 
      widespread occurrence of archaea related to Candidatus Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens (ANME-2d) known to mediate anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). 
      However, it is unclear whether ANME-2d mediates AOM in the deep continental 
      biosphere. In this study, we found the dominance of ANME-2d in groundwater 
      enriched in sulfate and methane from a 300-m deep underground borehole in 
      granitic rock. A near-complete genome of one representative species of the 
      ANME-2d obtained from the underground borehole has most of functional genes 
      required for AOM and assimilatory sulfate reduction. The genome of the subsurface 
      ANME-2d is different from those of other members of ANME-2d by lacking functional 
      genes encoding nitrate and nitrite reductases and multiheme cytochromes. In 
      addition, the subsurface ANME-2d genome contains a membrane-bound NiFe 
      hydrogenase gene putatively involved in respiratory H(2) oxidation, which is 
      different from those of other methanotrophic archaea. Short-term incubation of 
      microbial cells collected from the granitic groundwater with (13)C-labeled 
      methane also demonstrates that AOM is linked to microbial sulfate reduction. 
      Given the prominence of granitic continental crust and sulfate and methane in 
      terrestrial subsurface fluids, we conclude that AOM may be widespread in the deep 
      continental biosphere.

TI  - Methane as fuel for anaerobic microorganisms.
PG  - 158-70
AB  - Methane has long been known to be used as a carbon and energy source by some 
      aerobic alpha- and delta-proteobacteria. In these organisms the metabolism of 
      methane starts with its oxidation with O(2) to methanol, a reaction catalyzed by 
      a monooxygenase and therefore restricted to the aerobic world. Methane has 
      recently been shown to also fuel the growth of anaerobic microorganisms. The 
      oxidation of methane with sulfate and with nitrate have been reported, but the 
      mechanisms of anaerobic methane oxidation still remains elusive. 
      Sulfate-dependent methane oxidation is catalyzed by methanotrophic archaea, which 
      are related to the Methanosarcinales and which grow in close association with 
      sulfate-reducing delta-proteobacteria. There is evidence that anaerobic methane 
      oxidation with sulfate proceeds at least in part via reversed methanogenesis 
      involving the nickel enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase for methane activation, 
      which under standard conditions is an endergonic reaction, and thus inherently 
      slow. Methane oxidation coupled to denitrification is mediated by bacteria 
      belonging to a novel phylum and does not involve methyl-coenzyme M reductase. The 
      first step in methane oxidation is most likely the exergonic formation of 
      2-methylsuccinate from fumarate and methane catalyzed by a glycine-radical 
      enzyme.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals the contribution of anaerobic methanotroph-1b in the 
      oxidation of methane at the Ulleung Basin, East Sea of Korea.
PG  - 814-822
LID - 10.1007/s12275-016-6379-y [doi]
AB  - We have previously identified a sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) within the 
      methane hydrate-bearing sediment in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea of Korea, and the 
      presence of ANME-1b group in the sediment has been shown by phylogenetic analysis 
      of a 16S rRNA gene. Herein, we describe taxonomic and functional profiling in the 
      SMTZ sample by metagenomic analysis, comparing with that of surface sediment. 
      Metagenomic sequences of 115 Mbp and 252 Mbp were obtained from SMTZ and surface 
      sediments, respectively. The taxonomic profiling using BLASTX against the SEED 
      within MG-RAST showed the prevalence of methanogens (19.1%), such as 
      Methanosarcinales (12.0%) and Methanomicrobiales (4.1%) predominated within the 
      SMTZ metagenome. A number of 185,200 SMTZ reads (38.9%) and 438,484 surface reads 
      (62.5%) were assigned to functional categories, and methanogenesis-related reads 
      were statistically significantly overrepresented in the SMTZ metagenome. However, 
      the mapping analysis of metagenome reads to the reference genomes, most of the 
      sequences of the SMTZ metagenome were mapped to ANME-1 draft genomes, rather than 
      those of methanogens. Furthermore, the two copies of the methyl-coenzyme M 
      reductase gene (mcrA) segments of the SMTZ metagenome were clustered with ANME-1b 
      in the phylogenetic cluster. These results indicate that ANME-1b reads were 
      miss-annotated to methanogens due to limitation of database. Many of key genes 
      necessary for reverse methanogenesis were present in the SMTZ metagenome, except 
      for N (5),N (10)-methenyl-H(4)MPT reductase (mer) and CoB-CoM heterodisulfide 
      reductase subunits D and E (hdrDE). These data suggest that the ANME-1b 
      represents the primary player the anaerobic methane oxidation in the SMTZ, of the 
      methane hydrate-bearing sediment at the Ulleung Basin, East Sea of Korea.

AB  - Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas on earth. It is produced by 
      methanogenic archaea, which play an important role in the global carbon cycle. 
      Three main methanogenesis pathways are known: in the hydrogenotrophic pathway 
      H(2) and carbon dioxide are used for methane production, whereas in the 
      methylotrophic pathway small methylated carbon compounds like methanol and 
      methylated amines are used. In the aceticlastic pathway, acetate is 
      disproportionated to methane and carbon dioxide. However, next to these 
      conventional substrates, further methanogenic substrates and pathways have been 
      discovered. Several phylogenetically distinct methanogenic lineages 
      (Methanosphaera, Methanimicrococcus, Methanomassiliicoccus, 
      Methanonatronarchaeum) have evolved hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic 
      methanogenesis without the ability to perform either hydrogenotrophic or 
      methylotrophic methanogenesis. Genome analysis of the deep branching 
      Methanonatronarchaeum revealed an interesting membrane-bound hydrogenase complex 
      affiliated with the hardly described class 4 g of multisubunit hydrogenases 
      possibly providing reducing equivalents for anabolism. Furthermore, methylated 
      sulfur compounds such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and 
      methylmercaptopropionate were described to be converted into adapted 
      methylotrophic methanogenesis pathways of Methanosarcinales strains. Moreover, 
      recently it has been shown that the methanogen Methermicoccus shengliensis can 
      use methoxylated aromatic compounds in methanogenesis. Also, tertiary amines like 
      choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine) or betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) have 
      been described as substrates for methane production in Methanococcoides and 
      Methanolobus strains. This review article will provide in-depth information on 
      genome-guided metabolic reconstructions, physiology, and biochemistry of these 
      unusual methanogenesis pathways. KEY POINTS: • Newly discovered methanogenic 
      substrates and pathways are reviewed for the first time. • The review provides an 
      in-depth analysis of unusual methanogenesis pathways. • The hydrogenase complex 
      of the deep branching Methanonatronarchaeum is analyzed.

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiy064 [doi]
LID - fiy064
AB  - Microorganisms are the drivers of biogeochemical methane and nitrogen cycles. 
      Essential roles of chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms in these cycles were 
      predicted long before their identification. Dedicated enrichment procedures, 
      metagenomics surveys and single-cell technologies have enabled the identification 
      of several new groups of most-wanted spookmicrobes, including novel 
      methoxydotrophic methanogens that produce methane from methylated coal compounds 
      and acetoclastic 'Candidatus Methanothrix paradoxum', which is active in oxic 
      soils. The resultant energy-rich methane can be oxidized via a suite of electron 
      acceptors. Recently, 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' ANME-2d archaea 
      and 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' bacteria were enriched on nitrate and 
      nitrite under anoxic conditions with methane as an electron donor. Although 
      'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' and other ANME archaea can use iron 
      citrate as an electron acceptor in batch experiments, the quest for anaerobic 
      methane oxidizers that grow via iron reduction continues. In recent years, the 
      nitrogen cycle has been expanded by the discovery of various ammonium-oxidizing 
      prokaryotes, including ammonium-oxidizing archaea, versatile anaerobic 
      ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria and complete ammonium-oxidizing (comammox) 
      Nitrospira bacteria. Several biogeochemical studies have indicated that ammonium 
      conversion occurs under iron-reducing conditions, but thus far no microorganism 
      has been identified. Ultimately, iron-reducing and sulfate-dependent 
      ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms await discovery.

AB  - Methane-forming archaea are strictly anaerobic microbes and are essential for 
      global carbon fluxes since they perform the terminal step in breakdown of organic 
      matter in the absence of oxygen. Major part of methane produced in nature derives 
      from the methyl group of acetate. Only members of the genera Methanosarcina and 
      Methanosaeta are able to use this substrate for methane formation and growth. 
      Since the free energy change coupled to methanogenesis from acetate is only 
      -36kJ/mol CH4, aceticlastic methanogens developed efficient energy-conserving 
      systems to handle this thermodynamic limitation. The membrane bound electron 
      transport system of aceticlastic methanogens is a complex branched respiratory 
      chain that can accept electrons from hydrogen, reduced coenzyme F420 or reduced 
      ferredoxin. The terminal electron acceptor of this anaerobic respiration is a 
      mixed disulfide composed of coenzyme M and coenzyme B. Reduced ferredoxin has an 
      important function under aceticlastic growth conditions and novel and 
      well-established membrane complexes oxidizing ferredoxin will be discussed in 
      depth. Membrane bound electron transport is connected to energy conservation by 
      proton or sodium ion translocating enzymes (F420H2 dehydrogenase, Rnf complex, 
      Ech hydrogenase, methanophenazine-reducing hydrogenase and heterodisulfide 
      reductase). The resulting electrochemical ion gradient constitutes the driving 
      force for adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Methanogenesis, electron transport, 
      and the structure of key enzymes are discussed in this review leading to a 
      concept of how aceticlastic methanogens make a living. This article is part of a 
      Special Issue entitled: 18th European Bioenergetic Conference.

TI  - Methane from acetate.
PG  - 5489-95
AB  - The general features are known for the pathway by which most methane is produced 
      in nature. All acetate-utilizing methanogenic microorganisms contain CODH which 
      catalyzes the cleavage of acetyl-CoA; however, the pathway differs from all other 
      acetate-utilizing anaerobes in that the methyl group is reduced to methane with 
      electrons derived from oxidation of the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA to CO2. The 
      current understanding of the methanogenic fermentation of acetate provides 
      impressions of nature's novel solutions to problems of methyl transfer, electron 
      transport, and energy conservation. The pathway is now at a level of 
      understanding that will permit productive investigations of these and other 
      interesting questions in the near future.

TI  - Presence of diverse nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea in 
      sewage sludge.
PG  - 775-783
LID - 10.1111/jam.14502 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the community diversity and abundance 
      of nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea, Candidatus 
      Methanoperedens nitroreducens, in sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Seasonal sampling of the sewage sludge was carried out from 
      two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the northern and southern 
      parts of China. Through amplicon sequencing using our newly designed primers, a 
      large number of Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens-like (M. nitroreducens) 
      archaeal sequences (638 743) were generated. These sequences were assigned into 
      742 operational protein units (OPUs) at 90% cut-off level and classified as Group 
      B member of M. nitroreducens archaea in the phylogenetic tree. More than 80% of 
      the OPUs were not shared between these two WWTPs, showing the M. 
      nitroreducens-like archaeal community in each WWTP was unique. Quantitative PCR 
      assays also confirmed the presence of M. nitroreducens-like archaea and revealed 
      a higher abundance in autumn and winter than other seasons, indicating that the 
      environmental attributes in these seasons might favour the growth of this 
      archaea. Further redundancy analysis revealed that volatile solid and pH were the 
      significant environmental attributes (P < 0·05) in shaping the M. 
      nitroreducens-like archaeal community based on variance inflation factor 
      selection and Monte Carlo permutation test. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed 
      the presence of diverse M. nitroreducens-like archaea in sewage sludge using 
      Illumina-based mcrA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR assays. SIGNIFICANCE AND 
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study revealed the ecological 
      characteristics of M. nitroreducens-like archaea in sewage sludge that improved 
      our understanding of nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation process and 
      may be the basis for future application of M. nitroreducens-like archaea for new 
      nitrogen removal in WWTPs.

AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) microorganisms widespread in nature and they 
      are able to utilize methane as electron donor to reduce sulfate, nitrate, 
      nitrite, and high valence metals. However, whether persistent organic 
      contaminants can also be degraded remains unknown. In this study, the organic 
      pollutant methyl orange (MO) was used to address this open question. The initial 
      concentration of MO affected its degradation efficiency and higher concentration 
      (>100 mg/L) caused considerable inhibition. A (13)CH(4) isotope experiment 
      indicated that methane oxidation was involved in MO degradation, which produced 
      N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid corresponded 
      stoichiometrically. During the long-term experiment, the maximum degradation rate 
      was 47.91 mg/(L·d). The percentage of Candidatus Methanoperedens and 
      Pseudoxanthomonas significantly increased after 30-d of MO degradation under 
      CH(4) conditions; moreover, Candidatus Methanoperedens dominated (46.83%) the 
      microbial community. Candidatus Methanoperedens, either alone or in combination 
      with Pseudoxanthomonas, utilized methane as the sole carbon source to degrade MO 
      via direct interspecies electron transfer or the syntrophy pathway. This study 
      will add to our understanding of the functions and applications of AOM 
      microorganisms.

TI  - [Acclimatization and characteristics of microbial community in sulphate-dependent 
      anaerobic methane oxidation].
PG  - 4602-9
AB  - The greenhouse effect of methane is 26 times worse than that of carbon dioxide, 
      and wastewater containing high concentrations of sulfate is harmful to water, 
      soil and plants. Therefore, anaerobic oxidation of methane driven by sulfate is 
      one of the effective ways for methane reduction. In this paper, with sulfate as 
      the electron accepter, a microbial consortium capable of oxidating methane under 
      anaerobic condition was cultured. The diversity and characteristics of bacterial 
      and archaeal community were investigated by PCR-DGGE, and phylogenetic analysis 
      of the dominant microorganisms was also carried out. The DGGE fingerprints showed 
      that microbial community structure changed distinctly, and the abundance of 
      methane-oxidizing archea and sulfate-reducing bacteria increased in the 
      acclimatization system added sulfate. After acclimatization, the bacterial 
      diversity increased, while archaea diversity decreased slightly. The 
      representative bands in the DGGE profiles were excised and sequenced. Results 
      indicated that the dominant species in the acclimatization system were 
      Spirochaetes, Desulfuromonadales, Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta. Methane 
      converted into carbon dioxide while sulfate transformed into hydrogen sulfide and 
      sulfur in the process of anaerobic methane oxidation accompanied by sulphate 
      reduction.

AB  - Most of the methane produced in nature derives from the methyl group of acetate, 
      the major end product of anaerobes decomposing complex plant material. The 
      acetate is derived from the metabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA via the combined 
      activities of phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase. In Methanosarcina 
      species, the enzymes function in the reverse direction to activate acetate to 
      acetyl-CoA prior to cleavage into a methyl and carbonyl group of which the latter 
      is oxidized providing electrons for reduction of the former to methane. Thus, 
      phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase have a central role in the conversion of 
      complex organic matter to methane by anaerobic microbial food chains. Both 
      enzymes have been purified from Methanosarcina thermophila and characterized. 
      Both enzymes from M. thermophila have also been produced in Escherichia coli 
      permitting crystal structures and amino acid variants, the kinetic and 
      biochemical studies of which have lead to proposals for catalytic mechanisms. The 
      high identity of both enzymes to paralogs in the domain Bacteria suggests ancient 
      origins and common mechanisms.

TI  - Environmental evaluation of coexistence of denitrifying anaerobic 
      methane-oxidizing archaea and bacteria in a paddy field.
PG  - 439-46

AB  - The nitrate-dependent denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) process, 
      which is metabolized together by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and NC10 phylum 
      bacteria, is expected to be important for the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. 
      However, there are little studies about the existence of this process and the 
      functional microbes in environments. Therefore, the coexistence of DAMO archaea 
      and bacteria in a paddy field was evaluated in this study. Next-generation 
      sequencing showed that the two orders, Methanosarcinales and Nitrospirales, to 
      which DAMO archaea and DAMO bacteria belong, were detected in the four soil 
      samples. Then the in vitro experiments demonstrated both of nitrite- and 
      nitrate-dependent DAMO activities, which confirmed the coexistence of DAMO 
      archaea and DAMO bacteria. It was the first report about the coexistence of DAMO 
      archaea and bacteria in a paddy field. Furthermore, anammox bacteria were 
      detected in two of the four samples. The in vitro experiments did not show 
      anammox activity in the initial period but showed low anammox activity after 
      20 days' enrichment. These results implicated that anammox bacteria may coexist 
      with DAMO microorganisms in this field, but at a very low percentage.

      pleomorphic life cycle.
PG  - 321-331
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01292-9 [doi]
AB  - 'Candidatus Methanoperedens' are anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea with 
      global importance to methane cycling. Here meta-omics and fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH) were applied to characterize a bioreactor dominated by 
      'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' performing anaerobic methane oxidation 
      coupled to nitrate reduction. Unexpectedly, FISH revealed the stable co-existence 
      of two 'Ca. M. nitroreducens' morphotypes: the archetypal coccobacilli 
      microcolonies and previously unreported planktonic rods. Metagenomic analysis 
      showed that the 'Ca. M. nitroreducens' morphotypes were genomically identical but 
      had distinct gene expression profiles for proteins associated with carbon 
      metabolism, motility and cell division. In addition, a third distinct phenotype 
      was observed, with some coccobacilli 'Ca. M. nitroreducens' storing carbon as 
      polyhydroxyalkanoates. The phenotypic variation of 'Ca. M. nitroreducens' 
      probably aids their survival and dispersal in the face of sub-optimal 
      environmental conditions. These findings further demonstrate the remarkable 
      ability of members of the 'Ca. Methanoperedens' to adapt to their environment.

PG  - e0036323
LID - 10.1128/jb.00363-23 [doi]
LID - e00363-23
AB  - Methanogenesis is a key step during anaerobic biomass degradation. Methanogenic 
      archaea (methanogens) are the only organisms coupling methanogenic substrate 
      conversion to energy conservation. The range of substrates utilized by 
      methanogens is limited, with acetate and H(2)+CO(2) being the ecologically most 
      relevant. The only single methanogenic energy substrate containing more 
      carbon-carbon bonds than acetate is pyruvate. Only the aggregate-forming, 
      freshwater methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri Fusaro was shown to grow on this 
      compound. Here, the pyruvate-utilizing capabilities of the single-celled, marine 
      Methanosarcina acetivorans were addressed. Robust pyruvate-dependent, 
      methanogenic, growth could be established by omitting CO(2) from the growth 
      medium. Growth rates which were independent of the pyruvate concentration 
      indicated that M. acetivorans actively translocates pyruvate across the 
      cytoplasmic membrane. When 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) inhibited methanogenesis 
      to more than 99%, pyruvate-dependent growth was acetogenic and sustained. 
      However, when methanogenesis was completely inhibited M. acetivorans did not grow 
      on pyruvate. Analysis of metabolites showed that acetogenesis is used by 
      BES-inhibited M. acetivorans as a sink for electrons derived from pyruvate 
      oxidation and that other, thus far unidentified, metabolites are 
      produced.IMPORTANCEThe known range of methanogenic growth substrates is very 
      limited and M. acetivorans is only the second methanogenic species for which 
      growth on pyruvate is demonstrated. Besides some commonalities, analysis of M. 
      acetivorans highlights differences in pyruvate metabolism among Methanosarcina 
      species. The observation that M. acetivorans probably imports pyruvate actively 
      indicates that the capabilities for heterotrophic catabolism in methanogens may 
      be underestimated. The mostly acetogenic growth of M. acetivorans on pyruvate 
      with concomitant inhibition of methanogenesis confirms that energy conservation 
      of methanogenic archaea can be independent of methane formation.

TI  - Response of the Anaerobic Methanotroph "Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens" 
      to Oxygen Stress.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01832-18 [doi]
LID - e01832-18
AB  - "Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens" is an archaeon that couples the 
      anaerobic oxidation of methane to nitrate reduction. In natural and man-made 
      ecosystems, this archaeon is often found at oxic-anoxic interfaces where nitrate, 
      the product of aerobic nitrification, cooccurs with methane produced by 
      methanogens. As such, populations of "Ca Methanoperedens nitroreducens" could be 
      prone to regular oxygen exposure. Here, we investigated the effect of 5% 
      (vol/vol) oxygen exposure in batch activity assays on a "Ca Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens" culture, enriched from an Italian paddy field. Metagenome 
      sequencing of the DNA extracted from the enrichment culture revealed that 83% of 
      16S rRNA gene reads were assigned to a novel strain, "Candidatus Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens Verserenetto." RNA was extracted, and metatranscriptome sequencing 
      upon oxygen exposure revealed that the active community changed, most notably in 
      the appearance of aerobic methanotrophs. The gene expression of "Ca 
      Methanoperedens nitroreducens" revealed that the key genes encoding enzymes of 
      the methane oxidation and nitrate reduction pathways were downregulated. In 
      contrast to this, we identified upregulation of glutaredoxin, thioredoxin 
      family/like proteins, rubrerythrins, peroxiredoxins, peroxidase, alkyl 
      hydroperoxidase, type A flavoproteins, FeS cluster assembly protein, and cysteine 
      desulfurases, indicating the genomic potential of "Ca Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens Verserenetto" to counteract the oxidative damage and adapt in 
      environments where they might be exposed to regular oxygen intrusion.IMPORTANCE 
      "Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens" is an anaerobic archaeon which couples 
      the reduction of nitrate to the oxidation of methane. This microorganism is 
      present in a wide range of aquatic environments and man-made ecosystems, such as 
      paddy fields and wastewater treatment systems. In such environments, these 
      archaea may experience regular oxygen exposure. However, "Ca Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens" is able to thrive under such conditions and could be applied for 
      the simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and nitrogenous pollutants in 
      oxygen-limited systems. To understand what machinery "Ca Methanoperedens 
      nitroreducens" possesses to counteract the oxidative stress and survive, we 
      characterized the response to oxygen exposure using a multi-omics approach.

TI  - Energy Conservation and Hydrogenase Function in Methanogenic Archaea, in 
      Particular the Genus Methanosarcina.

LID - e00020-19
AB  - The biological production of methane is vital to the global carbon cycle and 
      accounts for ca. 74% of total methane emissions. The organisms that facilitate 
      this process, methanogenic archaea, belong to a large and phylogenetically 
      diverse group that thrives in a wide range of anaerobic environments. Two main 
      subgroups exist within methanogenic archaea: those with and those without 
      cytochromes. Although a variety of metabolisms exist within this group, the 
      reduction of growth substrates to methane using electrons from molecular hydrogen 
      is, in a phylogenetic sense, the most widespread methanogenic pathway. 
      Methanogens without cytochromes typically generate methane by the reduction of 
      CO(2) with electrons derived from H(2), formate, or secondary alcohols, 
      generating a transmembrane ion gradient for ATP production via an 
      Na(+)-translocating methyltransferase (Mtr). These organisms also conserve energy 
      with a novel flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism, wherein the endergonic 
      reduction of ferredoxin is facilitated by the exergonic reduction of a disulfide 
      terminal electron acceptor coupled to either H(2) or formate oxidation. 
      Methanogens that utilize cytochromes have a broader substrate range, and can 
      convert acetate and methylated compounds to methane, in addition to the ability 
      to reduce CO(2) Cytochrome-containing methanogens are able to supplement the ion 
      motive force generated by Mtr with an H(+)-translocating electron transport 
      system. In both groups, enzymes known as hydrogenases, which reversibly 
      interconvert protons and electrons to molecular hydrogen, play a central role in 
      the methanogenic process. This review discusses recent insight into methanogen 
      metabolism and energy conservation mechanisms with a particular focus on the 
      genus Methanosarcina.

AB  - Anaerobic methane oxidation exerts a key control on greenhouse gas emissions(1), 
      yet factors that modulate the activity of microorganisms performing this function 
      remain poorly understood. Here we discovered extraordinarily large, diverse DNA 
      sequences that primarily encode hypothetical proteins through studying 
      groundwater, sediments and wetland soil where methane production and oxidation 
      occur. Four curated, complete genomes are linear, up to approximately 1 Mb in 
      length and share genome organization, including replichore structure, long 
      inverted terminal repeats and genome-wide unique perfect tandem direct repeats 
      that are intergenic or generate amino acid repeats. We infer that these are 
      highly divergent archaeal extrachromosomal elements with a distinct evolutionary 
      origin. Gene sequence similarity, phylogeny and local divergence of sequence 
      composition indicate that many of their genes were assimilated from 
      methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens archaea. We refer to these elements as 'Borgs'. 
      We identified at least 19 different Borg types coexisting with Methanoperedens 
      spp. in four distinct ecosystems. Borgs provide methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens 
      archaea access to genes encoding proteins involved in redox reactions and energy 
      conservation (for example, clusters of multihaem cytochromes and methyl coenzyme 
      M reductase). These data suggest that Borgs might have previously unrecognized 
      roles in the metabolism of this group of archaea, which are known to modulate 
      greenhouse gas emissions, but further studies are now needed to establish their 
      functional relevance.

AB  - Anaerobic biological techniques are widely used in the reductive decolorization 
      of textile wastewater. However, the decolorization efficiency of textile 
      wastewater by conventional anaerobic biological techniques is generally limited 
      due to the low biomass retention capacity and short hydraulic retention time 
      (HRT). In this study, a methane-based hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (HfMBR) 
      was initially inoculated with an enriched anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) 
      culture to rapidly form an anaerobic biofilm. Then, synthetic azo dye wastewater 
      containing methyl orange (MO) was fed into the HfMBR. MO decolorization 
      efficiency of ∼ 100 % (HRT = 2 to 1.5 days) and maximum decolorization rate of 
      883 mg/L/day (HRT = 0.5 day) were obtained by the stepwise increase of the MO 
      loading rate into the methane-based HfMBR. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis visually revealed that archaea 
      clusters formed synergistic consortia with adjacent bacteria. Quantitative PCR 
      (qPCR), phylogenetic and high-throughput sequencing analysis results further 
      confirmed the biological consortia formation of methane-related archaea and 
      partner bacteria, which played a synergistic role in MO decolorization. The high 
      removal efficiency and stable microbial structure in HfMBR suggest it is a 
      potentially effective technique for high-toxic azo dyes removal from textile 
      wastewater.

LID - 10.1002/bit.26208 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated anaerobic conversion of the greenhouse gas methane 
      into acetate using an engineered archaeon that produces methyl-coenzyme M 
      reductase (Mcr) from unculturable microorganisms from a microbial mat in the 
      Black Sea to create the first culturable prokaryote that reverses methanogenesis 
      and grows anaerobically on methane. In this work, we further engineered the same 
      host with the goal of converting methane into butanol. Instead, we discovered a 
      process for converting methane to a secreted valuable product, L-lactate, with 
      sufficient optical purity for synthesizing the biodegradable plastic poly-lactic 
      acid. We determined that the 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hbd) from 
      Clostridium acetobutylicum is responsible for lactate production. This work 
      demonstrates the first metabolic engineering of a methanogen with a synthetic 
      pathway; in effect, we produce a novel product (lactate) from a novel substrate 
      (methane) by cloning the three genes for Mcr and one for Hbd. We further 
      demonstrate the utility of anaerobic methane conversion with an increased lactate 
      yield compared to aerobic methane conversion to lactate. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

AB  - The Gulf of Cádiz is a tectonically active continental margin with over sixty mud 
      volcanoes (MV) documented, some associated with active methane (CH(4)) seepage. 
      However, the role of prokaryotes in influencing this CH(4) release is largely 
      unknown. In two expeditions (MSM1-3 and JC10) seven Gulf of Cádiz MVs (Porto, 
      Bonjardim, Carlos Ribeiro, Captain Arutyunov, Darwin, Meknes, and Mercator) were 
      analyzed for microbial diversity, geochemistry, and methanogenic activity, plus 
      substrate amended slurries also measured potential methanogenesis and anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane (AOM). Prokaryotic populations and activities were variable 
      in these MV sediments reflecting the geochemical heterogeneity within and between 
      them. There were also marked differences between many MV and their reference 
      sites. Overall direct cell numbers below the SMTZ (0.2-0.5 mbsf) were much lower 
      than the general global depth distribution and equivalent to cell numbers from 
      below 100 mbsf. Methanogenesis from methyl compounds, especially methylamine, 
      were much higher than the usually dominant substrates H(2)/CO(2) or acetate. 
      Also, CH(4) production occurred in 50% of methylated substrate slurries and only 
      methylotrophic CH(4) production occurred at all seven MV sites. These slurries 
      were dominated by Methanococcoides methanogens (resulting in pure cultures), and 
      prokaryotes found in other MV sediments. AOM occurred in some slurries, 
      particularly, those from Captain Arutyunov, Mercator and Carlos Ribeiro MVs. 
      Archaeal diversity at MV sites showed the presence of both methanogens and ANME 
      (Methanosarcinales, Methanococcoides, and ANME-1) related sequences, and 
      bacterial diversity was higher than archaeal diversity, dominated by members of 
      the Atribacterota, Chloroflexota, Pseudomonadota, Planctomycetota, Bacillota, and 
      Ca. "Aminicenantes." Further work is essential to determine the full contribution 
      of Gulf of Cádiz mud volcanoes to the global methane and carbon cycles.

AB  - The coupling between ferrous iron and methane production has important global 
      implications, with iron ions acting as electron acceptors for anaerobic oxidation 
      of methane (AOM) and inhibitors of methanogenesis in different environments, 
      including floodplain soils. In this sense, we analyzed the relationship between 
      Fe(II) concentration and methane production in soil layers collected at 0-15 cm 
      and 15-30 cm from flooded-forest and -agroforestry in Amazonian clear water 
      floodplain incubated in anaerobic batch reactors using acetate, formate and 
      glucose as organic sources. High throughput sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 
      16S rRNA genes was employed to assess the abundance and composition of the active 
      methanogenic and methanotrophic microbial groups potentially involved in 
      Fe(III)-dependent AOM in the soil used as inoculum. Positive correlation was 
      revealed between Fe(II) concentration and methane production, with higher 
      accumulation of Fe(II) in incubated soil layer collected at 0-15 cm in both 
      forest and agroforestry sites for all the three organic sources. The accumulation 
      of Fe(II) in the incubated soil evidenced the oxidation of Fe(III) potentially by 
      Methanobacterium, Desulfobulbus and 'Candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens' 
      living in anaerobic condition at this soil layer. The results point out to the 
      microbial ferric iron reduction as an important potential pathway for anaerobic 
      organic matter decomposition in Amazonian floodplain, evidencing methanogenesis 
      suppression by Fe(III) reduction in flooded-forest and -agroforestry in Amazonian 
      clear water river floodplain.

TI  - Methyl-compounds driven benthic carbon cycling in the sulfate-reducing sediments 
      of South China Sea.
PG  - 641-651
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.15110 [doi]
AB  - Methane is a potent greenhouse gas; methane production and consumption within 
      seafloor sediments has generated intense interest. Anaerobic oxidation of methane 
      (AOM) and methanogenesis (MOG) primarily occur at the depth of the 
      sulfate-methane transition zone or underlying sediment respectively. 
      Methanogenesis can also occur in the sulfate-reducing sediments through the 
      utilization of non-competitive methylated compounds; however, the occurrence and 
      importance of this process are not fully understood. Here, we combined a variety 
      of data, including geochemical measurements, rate measurements and molecular 
      analyses to demonstrate the presence of a cryptic methane cycle in 
      sulfate-reducing sediments from the continental shelf of the northern South China 
      Sea. The abundance of methanogenic substrates as well as the high MOG rates from 
      methylated compounds indicated that methylotrophic methanogenesis was the 
      dominant methanogenic pathway; this conclusion was further supported by the 
      presence of the methylotrophic genus Methanococcoides. High potential rates of 
      AOM were observed in the sediments, indicating that methane produced in situ 
      could be oxidized simultaneously by AOM, presumably by ANME-2a/b as indicated by 
      16S rRNA gene analysis. A significant correlation between the relative abundance 
      of methanogens and methanotrophs was observed over sediment depth, indicating 
      that methylotrophic methanogenesis could potentially fuel AOM in this 
      environment. In addition, higher potential rates of AOM than sulfate reduction 
      rates at in situ methane conditions were observed, making alternative electron 
      acceptors important to support AOM in sulfate-reducing sediment. AOM rates were 
      stimulated by the addition of Fe/Mn oxides, suggesting AOM could be partially 
      coupled to metal oxide reduction. These results suggest that methyl-compounds 
      driven methane production drives a cryptic methane cycling and fuels AOM coupled 
      to the reduction of sulfate and other electron acceptors.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion (AD) and microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) coupled system 
      has been proved to be a promising process for biomethane production. In this 
      paper, it was found that by co-cultivating Geobacter with Methanosarcina in an 
      AD-MEC coupled system, methane yield was further increased by 24.1%, achieving to 
      360.2 mL/g-COD, which was comparable to the theoretical methane yield of an 
      anaerobic digester. With the presence of Geobacter, the maximum chemical oxygen 
      demand (COD) removal rate (216.8 mg COD/(L·hr)) and current density (304.3A/m(3)) 
      were both increased by 1.3 and 1.8 fold compared to the previous study without 
      Geobacter, resulting in overall energy efficiency reaching up to 74.6%. Community 
      analysis demonstrated that Geobacter and Methanosarcina could coexist together in 
      the biofilm, and the electrochemical activities of both were confirmed by cyclic 
      voltammetry. Our study observed that the carbon dioxide content in total gas 
      generated from the AD reactor with Geobacter was only half of that generated from 
      the same reactor without Geobacter, suggesting that Methanosarcina may obtain the 
      electron transferred from Geobacter for the reduction of carbon dioxide to 
      methane. Taken together, Geobacter not only can improve the performance of the 
      MEC system, but also can enhance methane production.

AB  - Rivers are an important site for methane emissions and reactive nitrogen removal. 
      The process of nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) links the 
      global carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle, but its role in methane mitigation 
      and nitrogen removal in rivers is poorly known. In the present study, we 
      investigated the activity, abundance, and community composition of n-damo 
      bacteria in sediment of the upper, middle, and lower reaches of Wuxijiang River 
      (Zhejiang Province, China). The (13)CH(4) stable isotope experiments showed that 
      the methane oxidation activity of n-damo was 0.11-1.88 nmol CO(2) g(-1) (dry 
      sediment) d(-1), and the activity measured from the middle reaches was 
      significantly higher than that from the remaining regions. It was estimated that 
      3.27 g CH(4) m(-2) year(-1) and 8.72 g N m(-2) year(-1) could be consumed via 
      n-damo. Quantitative PCR confirmed the presence of n-damo bacteria, and their 16S 
      rRNA gene abundance varied between 5.45 × 10(5) and 5.86 × 10(6) copies g(-1) dry 
      sediment. Similarly, the abundance of n-damo bacteria was significantly higher in 
      the middle reaches. High-throughput sequencing showed a high n-damo bacterial 
      diversity, with totally 152 operational taxonomic units being detected at 97 % 
      sequence similarity cut-off. In addition, the n-damo bacterial community 
      composition also varied spatially. The inorganic nitrogen (NH(4)(+), NO(2)(-), 
      NO(3)(-)) level was found to be the key environmental factor controlling the 
      n-damo activity and bacterial community composition. Overall, our results showed 
      the spatial variations and environmental regulation of the activity and community 
      structure of n-damo bacteria in river sediment, which expanded our understanding 
      of the quantitative importance of n-damo in both methane oxidation and reactive 
      nitrogen removal in riverine systems.

AB  - ANaerobic MEthanotrophic (ANME) archaea remove the greenhouse gas methane from 
      anoxic environments and diminish its flux to the atmosphere. High methane removal 
      efficiencies are well documented in marine environments, whereas anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane (AOM) was only recently indicated as an important methane 
      sink in freshwater systems. Freshwater AOM-mediating microorganisms lack 
      taxonomic identification and only little is known about metabolic adaptions to 
      prevailing biogeochemical conditions. One of the first study sites providing 
      information about AOM activity in freshwater sediment is Lake Ørn, a low-sulfate, 
      iron-rich Danish lake. With the aim to identify freshwater AOM-mediating archaea, 
      we incubated AOM-active anoxic, nitrate-free freshwater sediment from Lake Ørn 
      with (13)C-labeled methane ((13)C(CH4)) and (13)C-labeled bicarbonate 
      ((13)C(DIC)) and followed the assimilation of (13)C into RNA by stable isotope 
      probing. While AOM was active, (13)C(CH4) and probably also (13)C(DIC) were 
      incorporated into uncultured archaea of the Methanosarcinales-related cluster 
      ANME-2d, whereas other known ANME lineages were not detected. This finding 
      strongly suggests that ANME-2d archaea perform AOM coupled to sulfate and/or iron 
      reduction and may have the capability of mixed assimilation of CH(4) and DIC. 
      ANME-2d archaea may thus play an important role in controlling methane emissions 
      from nitrate-depleted and low-sulfate freshwater systems.

AB  - Recently it has been shown that Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens', an 
      anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), can reduce nitrate to nitrite using 
      electrons derived from anaerobic oxidation of methane. In this study, the growth 
      kinetics of 'M. nitroreducens' enriched in a laboratory reactor were studied. In 
      the experimental concentration range (up to 16 mg CH(4) L(-1)), anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane by 'M. nitroreducens' was found to comply with first order 
      kinetic model with a rate constant of 0.019 ± 0.006 h(-1) and a biomass-specific 
      rate constant of 0.04-0.14 L h(-1) g(-1)VSS. Meanwhile, the nitrate reduction to 
      nitrite was well described by the Monod-type kinetic model with an affinity 
      constant for nitrate of 2.1 ± 0.4 mg N L(-1), which is slightly higher than, but 
      comparable to, that of most known denitrifying bacteria. This is the first time 
      that the growth kinetics of 'M. nitroreducens' have been experimentally studied. 
      The applicability of the kinetic model reported herein to this organism or 
      similar organisms in natural or engineering systems requires further 
      investigation.

PG  - 257-69
LID - 10.1007/s00203-008-0382-6 [doi]
AB  - Despite its toxicity for the majority of living matter on our planet, numerous 
      microorganisms, both aerobic and anaerobic, can use carbon monoxide (CO) as a 
      source of carbon and/or energy for growth. The capacity to employ 
      carboxidotrophic energy metabolism anaerobically is found in phylogenetically 
      diverse members of the Bacteria and the Archaea. The oxidation of CO is coupled 
      to numerous respiratory processes, such as desulfurication, hydrogenogenesis, 
      acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Although as diverse as the organisms capable of 
      it, any CO-dependent energy metabolism known depends on the presence of carbon 
      monoxide dehydrogenase. This review summarizes recent insights into the 
      CO-dependent physiology of anaerobic microorganisms with a focus on methanogenic 
      archaea. Carboxidotrophic growth of Methanosarcina acetivorans, thought to 
      strictly rely on the process of methanogenesis, also involves formation of 
      methylated thiols, formate, and even acetogenesis, and, thus, exemplifies how the 
      beneficial redox properties of CO can be exploited in unexpected ways by 
      anaerobic microorganisms.

PG  - 78-82
LID - 10.1038/nature21427 [doi]
AB  - Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an 
      enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic 
      methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F(430), a 
      nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl 
      radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F(430) 
      is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 
      11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve 
      chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic 
      ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of 
      coenzyme F(430) from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their 
      activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of 
      tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of 
      recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.

TI  - Use of 16S rRNA gene based clone libraries to assess microbial communities 
      potentially involved in anaerobic methane oxidation in a Mediterranean cold seep.
PG  - 384-98
AB  - This study provides data on the diversities of bacterial and archaeal communities 
      in an active methane seep at the Kazan mud volcano in the deep Eastern 
      Mediterranean sea. Layers of varying depths in the Kazan sediments were 
      investigated in terms of (1) chemical parameters and (2) DNA-based microbial 
      population structures. The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of 
      directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the 
      prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with 
      processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus 
      identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of 
      quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with 
      depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms 
      involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate 
      reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic 
      processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in 
      anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms 
      abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm). Communities in the middle layer 
      (6-22 cm) contained organisms that could be linked to either of the 
      aforementioned processes. We discuss how these phylogeny (sequence)-based 
      findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the 
      functioning and the functional diversities of the communities under study.

AB  - The conversion of biomass to CH4 (biomethanation) involves an anaerobic microbial 
      food chain composed of at least three metabolic groups of which the first two 
      decompose the complex biomass primarily to acetate, formate, and H2. The 
      thermodynamics of these conversions are unfavorable requiring a symbiosis with 
      the CH4-producing group (methanogens) that metabolize the decomposition products 
      to favorable concentrations. The methanogens produce CH4 by two major pathways, 
      conversion of the methyl group of acetate and reduction of CO2 coupled to the 
      oxidation of formate or H2. This review covers recent advances in the fundamental 
      understanding of both methanogenic pathways with the view of stimulating research 
      towards improving the rate and reliability of the overall biomethanation process.

AB  - Gas hydrates in marine sediments have been known for many years but recently 
      hydrates were found in the sediments of Lake Baikal, the largest freshwater basin 
      in the world. Marine gas hydrates are associated with complex microbial 
      communities involved in methanogenesis, methane oxidation, sulfate reduction and 
      other biotransformations. However, the contribution of microorganisms to the 
      formation of gas hydrates remains poorly understood. We examined the microbial 
      communities in the hydrate-bearing sediments and water column of Lake Baikal 
      using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria dominated 
      the water sample collected at the lake floor in the hydrate-bearing site. The 
      shallow sediments were dominated by Archaea. Methanogens of the orders 
      Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales were abundant, whereas representatives 
      of archaeal lineages known to perform anaerobic oxidation of methane, as well as 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria, were not found. Affiliation of archaea to methanogenic 
      rather than methane-oxidizing lineages was supported by analysis of the sequences 
      of the methyl coenzyme M reductase gene. The deeper sediments located at 85-90 cm 
      depth close to the hydrate were dominated by Bacteria, mostly assigned to 
      Chloroflexi, candidate division JS1 and Caldiserica. Overall, our results are 
      consistent with the biological origin of methane hydrates in Lake Baikal.

TI  - Vertical distribution of Candidatus Methylomirabilis and Methanoperedens in 
      agricultural soils.
PG  - 47

AB  - Candidatus Methylomirabilis-related bacteria conduct anaerobic oxidation of 
      methane (AOM) coupling with NO(2)(-) reduction, and Candidatus 
      Methanoperedens-related archaea perform AOM coupling with reduction of diverse 
      electron acceptors, including NO(3)(-), Fe (III), Mn (IV) and SO(4)(2-). 
      Application of nitrogen fertilization favors the growth of these methanotrophs in 
      agricultural fields. Here, we explored the vertical variations in community 
      structure and abundance of the two groups of methanotrophs in a nitrogen-rich 
      vegetable field via using illumina MiSeq sequencing and quantitative PCR. The 
      retrieved Methylomirabilis-related sequences had 91.12%-97.32% identity to the 
      genomes of known Methylomirabilis species, and Methanoperedens-related sequences 
      showed 85.49%-97.48% identity to the genomes of known Methanoperedens species 
      which are capable of conducting AOM coupling with reduction of NO(3)(-) or Fe 
      (III). The Methanoperedens-related archaeal diversity was significantly higher 
      than Methylomirabilis-related bacteria, with totally 74 and 16 operational 
      taxonomic units, respectively. In contrast, no significant difference in 
      abundance between the bacteria (9.19 × 10(3)-3.83 × 10(5) copies g(-1) dry soil) 
      and the archaea (1.55 × 10(4)-3.24 × 10(5) copies g(-1) dry soil) was observed. 
      Furthermore, the abundance of both groups of methanotrophs exhibited a strong 
      vertical variation, which peaked at 30-40 and 20-30 cm layers, respectively. Soil 
      water content and pH were the key factors influencing Methylomirabilis-related 
      bacterial diversity and abundance, respectively. For the Methanoperedens-related 
      archaea, both soil pH and ammonium content contributed significantly to the 
      changes of these archaeal diversity and abundance. Overall, we provide the first 
      insights into the vertical distribution and regulation of 
      Methylomirabilis-related bacteria and Methanoperedens-related archaea in 
      vegetable soils. KEY POINTS: • The archaeal diversity was significantly higher 
      than bacterial. • There was no significant difference in the abundance between 
      bacteria and archaea. • The abundance of bacteria and archaea peaked at 30-40 and 
      20-30 cm, respectively.

TI  - Comparative analysis of methane-oxidizing archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria 
      in anoxic marine sediments.
PG  - 1922-34
AB  - The oxidation of methane in anoxic marine sediments is thought to be mediated by 
      a consortium of methane-consuming archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. In this 
      study, we compared results of rRNA gene (rDNA) surveys and lipid analyses of 
      archaea and bacteria associated with methane seep sediments from several 
      different sites on the Californian continental margin. Two distinct archaeal 
      lineages (ANME-1 and ANME-2), peripherally related to the order 
      Methanosarcinales, were consistently associated with methane seep marine 
      sediments. The same sediments contained abundant (13)C-depleted archaeal lipids, 
      indicating that one or both of these archaeal groups are members of anaerobic 
      methane-oxidizing consortia. (13)C-depleted lipids and the signature 16S rDNAs 
      for these archaeal groups were absent in nearby control sediments. Concurrent 
      surveys of bacterial rDNAs revealed a predominance of delta-proteobacteria, in 
      particular, close relatives of Desulfosarcina variabilis. Biomarker analyses of 
      the same sediments showed bacterial fatty acids with strong (13)C depletion that 
      are likely products of these sulfate-reducing bacteria. Consistent with these 
      observations, whole-cell fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed aggregations 
      of ANME-2 archaea and sulfate-reducing Desulfosarcina and Desulfococcus species. 
      Additionally, the presence of abundant (13)C-depleted ether lipids, presumed to 
      be of bacterial origin but unrelated to ether lipids of members of the order 
      Desulfosarcinales, suggests the participation of additional bacterial groups in 
      the methane-oxidizing process. Although the Desulfosarcinales and ANME-2 
      consortia appear to participate in the anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine 
      sediments, our data suggest that other bacteria and archaea are also involved in 
      methane oxidation in these environments.

AB  - Recently, a microbial consortium was shown to couple the anaerobic oxidation of 
      methane to denitrification, predominantly in the form of nitrite reduction to 
      dinitrogen gas. This consortium was dominated by bacteria of an as yet 
      uncharacterized division and archaea of the order Methanosarcinales. The present 
      manuscript reports on the upscaling of the enrichment culture, and addresses the 
      role of the archaea in methane oxidation. The key gene of methanotrophic and 
      methanogenic archaea, mcrA, was sequenced. The associated cofactor F(430) was 
      shown to have a mass of 905 Da, the same as for methanogens and different from 
      the heavier form (951 Da) found in methanotrophic archaea. After prolonged 
      enrichment (> 1 year), no inhibition of anaerobic methane oxidation was observed 
      in the presence of 20 mM bromoethane sulfonate, a specific inhibitor of MCR. 
      Optimization of the cultivation conditions led to higher rates of methane 
      oxidation and to the decline of the archaeal population, as shown by fluorescence 
      in situ hybridization and quantitative MALDI-TOF analysis of F(430). Mass 
      balancing showed that methane oxidation was still coupled to nitrite reduction in 
      the total absence of oxygen. Together, our results show that bacteria can couple 
      the anaerobic oxidation of methane to denitrification without the involvement of 
      Archaea.

AB  - Vanadium (V) is a transitional metal that poses health risks to exposed humans. 
      Microorganisms play an important role in remediating V contamination by reducing 
      more toxic and mobile vanadate (V(V)) to less toxic and mobile V(IV). In this 
      study, DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with metagenomic-binning was used 
      to identify microorganisms responsible for V(V) reduction and determine potential 
      metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a V-contaminated river sediment. 
      Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing 
      bacteria, while Methanosarcina spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing 
      archaea. The bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases NarG and NapA for 
      respiratory V(V) reduction, as has been demonstrated previously for other 
      species. It is proposed that Methanosarcina spp. may reduce V(V) via anaerobic 
      methane oxidation pathways (AOM-V) rather than via respiratory V(V) reduction 
      performed by their bacterial counterparts, as indicated by the presence of genes 
      associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the 
      metagenome assembled genome (MAG) of Methanosarcina. Briefly, methane may be 
      oxidized through the "reverse methanogenesis" pathway to produce electrons, which 
      may be further captured by V(V) to promote V(V) reduction. More specially, V(V) 
      reduction by members of Methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport 
      (CoMS-SCoB heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE), F(420)H(2) dehydrogenases (Fpo), 
      and multi-heme c-type cytochrome (MHC)). The identification of putative 
      V(V)-reducing bacteria and archaea and the prediction of their different pathways 
      for V(V) reduction expand current knowledge regarding the potential fate of V(V) 
      in contaminated sites.

TI  - The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic 
      archaea.
PG  - 339-342
AB  - Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme of methanogenesis and 
      anaerobic methane oxidation. The activity of MCR is dependent on the unique 
      nickel-containing tetrapyrrole known as coenzyme F430. We used comparative 
      genomics to identify the coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (cfb) genes and characterized 
      the encoded enzymes from Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A. The pathway involves 
      nickelochelation by a nickel-specific chelatase, followed by amidation to form 
      Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide. Next, a primitive homolog of nitrogenase 
      mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur 
      ligase homolog forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the 
      pathway. These data show that coenzyme F430 can be synthesized from 
      sirohydrochlorin using Cfb enzymes produced heterologously in a nonmethanogen 
      host and identify several targets for inhibitors of biological methane formation.

TI  - Effects of florfenicol on methane accumulation and changes in the structure of 
      the prokaryotic community in a water-sediment system.
PG  - 157444

AB  - Florfenicol has been widely used in the veterinary and aquaculture to control 
      bacterial diseases because of its high efficacy, quick effect, and low cost. The 
      water-sediment system has become an important sink for florfenicol, and the 
      anaerobic environment of lake sediments is favorable for methane (CH(4)) 
      production. Although antibiotics may impact methanogenesis under anaerobic 
      conditions, the influence of florfenicol on CH(4) accumulation in anaerobic 
      water-sediment system remains uncertain. This study evaluated how florfenicol 
      affects CH(4) accumulation and the structure of the prokaryotic community in a 
      water-sediment system. Anaerobic systems with different florfenicol 
      concentrations (0, 0.2, 1, 5 and 10 mg/L) were incubated and CH(4) accumulation, 
      pH, total organic carbon content, degradation ratio of florfenicol, and structure 
      of the prokaryotic community were monitored. It was found that CH(4) accumulation 
      raised in low florfenicol (0.2 and 1 mg/L) systems during the growth period, 
      while CH(4) accumulation declined in high florfenicol (5 and 10 mg/L) systems. In 
      the first 13 d, 83.67-99.30 % of florfenicol degraded in different treatments. 
      The addition of florfenicol also influenced the structure of the prokaryotic 
      community of the sediments. Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant at the 
      phylum level. The dominant taxa at the order level gradually changed from 
      Methanomicrobiales to Methanobacteriales, and finally to Methanosarcinales, 
      indicating the dynamic transformation of methanogens in the reactor. This study 
      reveals the effects of florfenicol on CH(4) production under anaerobic conditions 
      and provides a theoretical basis for further research on the underlying 
      mechanisms. The findings also provide some basic data on the impact of new 
      pollutants on the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emission.

TI  - Crystal structure of a key enzyme for anaerobic ethane activation.
PG  - 118-121
LID - 10.1126/science.abg1765 [doi]
AB  - Ethane, the second most abundant hydrocarbon gas in the seafloor, is efficiently 
      oxidized by anaerobic archaea in syntrophy with sulfate-reducing bacteria. Here, 
      we report the 0.99-angstrom-resolution structure of the proposed 
      ethane-activating enzyme and describe the specific traits that distinguish it 
      from methane-generating and -consuming methyl-coenzyme M reductases. The widened 
      catalytic chamber, harboring a dimethylated nickel-containing F(430) cofactor, 
      would adapt the chemistry of methyl-coenzyme M reductases for a two-carbon 
      substrate. A sulfur from methionine replaces the oxygen from a canonical 
      glutamine as the nickel lower-axial ligand, a feature conserved in thermophilic 
      ethanotrophs. Specific loop extensions, a four-helix bundle dilatation, and 
      posttranslational methylations result in the formation of a 33-angstrom-long 
      hydrophobic tunnel, which guides the ethane to the buried active site as 
      confirmed with xenon pressurization experiments.

AB  - We investigated methane production and oxidation and the depth distribution and 
      phylogenetic affiliation of a functional gene for methanogenesis, methyl coenzyme 
      M reductase subunit A (mcrA), at two sites of the Integrated Ocean Drilling 
      Program Expedition 311. These sites, U1327 and U1329, are respectively inside and 
      outside the area of gas hydrate distribution on the Cascadia Margin. Radiotracer 
      experiments using (14)C-labelled substrates indicated high potential methane 
      production rates in hydrate-bearing sediments [128-223 m below seafloor (mbsf)] 
      at U1327 and in sediments between 70 and 140 mbsf at U1329. Tracer-free 
      experiments indicated high cumulative methane production in sediments within and 
      below the gas hydrate layer at U1327 and in sediments below 70 mbsf at U1329. 
      Stable tracer experiments using (13)C-labelled methane showed high potential 
      methane oxidation rates in near-surface sediments and in sediments deeper than 
      100 mbsf at both sites. Results of polymerase chain reaction amplification of 
      mcrA in DNA were mostly consistent with methane production: relatively strong 
      mcrA amplification was detected in the gas hydrate-bearing sediments at U1327, 
      whereas at U1329, it was mainly detected in sediments from around the 
      bottom-simulating reflector (126 mbsf). Phylogenetic analysis of mcrA separated 
      it into four phylotype clusters: two clusters of methanogens, Methanosarcinales 
      and Methanobacteriales, and two clusters of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, 
      ANME-I and ANME-II groups, supporting the activity measurement results. These 
      results reveal that in situ methanogenesis in deep sediments probably contributes 
      to gas hydrate formation and are inconsistent with the geochemical model that 
      microbial methane currently being generated in shallow sediments migrates 
      downward and contributes to the hydrate formation. At Site U1327, gas hydrates 
      occurred in turbidite sediments, which were absent at Site U1329, suggesting that 
      a geological setting suitable for a gas hydrate reservoir is more important for 
      the accumulation of gas hydrate than microbiological properties.

AB  - This case study aimed to isolate and identify methanogenic bacteria from landfill 
      soil, mud, and leachate samples to assess their role in anaerobic digestion and 
      biogas production. Anaerobic digestion involves the breakdown of organic matter 
      by a diverse group of bacteria under oxygen-free conditions, resulting in the 
      production of methane and carbon dioxide. The collected samples from the landfill 
      were cultured in a modified mineral salt medium (MSM). Microscopic observations 
      revealed distinct coccus and bacillus morphologies of the isolated methanogenic 
      bacteria. Gas production experiments and substrate utilization studies identified 
      two types of methanogens. Methanosarcina sp., which utilized acetate and methanol 
      for methane production, and Methanobacterium sp., utilizing hydrogen and carbon 
      dioxide, as well as acetate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis 
      confirmed the different morphotypes of the isolated methanogens. The study 
      findings demonstrated the presence of diverse methanogens in the landfill 
      environment, contributing to anaerobic digestion and biogas production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methanosarcina acetivorans is a model archaeon with renewed interest 
      due to its unique reversible methane production pathways. However, the mechanism 
      and relevant pathways implicated in (co)utilizing novel carbon substrates in this 
      organism are still not fully understood. This paper provides a comprehensive 
      inventory of thermodynamically feasible routes for anaerobic methane oxidation, 
      co-reactant utilization, and maximum carbon yields of major biofuel candidates by 
      M. acetivorans. RESULTS: Here, an updated genome-scale metabolic model of M. 
      acetivorans is introduced (iMAC868 containing 868 genes, 845 reactions, and 718 
      metabolites) by integrating information from two previously reconstructed 
      metabolic models (i.e., iVS941 and iMB745), modifying 17 reactions, adding 24 new 
      reactions, and revising 64 gene-protein-reaction associations based on newly 
      available information. The new model establishes improved predictions of growth 
      yields on native substrates and is capable of correctly predicting the knockout 
      outcomes for 27 out of 28 gene deletion mutants. By tracing a bifurcated electron 
      flow mechanism, the iMAC868 model predicts thermodynamically feasible 
      (co)utilization pathway of methane and bicarbonate using various terminal 
      electron acceptors through the reversal of the aceticlastic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This effort paves the way in informing the search for thermodynamically feasible 
      ways of (co)utilizing novel carbon substrates in the domain Archaea.

TI  - A Membrane-Bound Cytochrome Enables Methanosarcina acetivorans To Conserve Energy 
      from Extracellular Electron Transfer.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00789-19 [doi]
LID - e00789-19
AB  - Extracellular electron exchange in Methanosarcina species and closely related 
      Archaea plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and enhances the speed 
      and stability of anaerobic digestion by facilitating efficient syntrophic 
      interactions. Here, we grew Methanosarcina acetivorans with methanol provided as 
      the electron donor and the humic analogue, anthraquione-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), 
      provided as the electron acceptor when methane production was inhibited with 
      bromoethanesulfonate. AQDS was reduced with simultaneous methane production in 
      the absence of bromoethanesulfonate. Transcriptomics revealed that expression of 
      the gene for the transmembrane, multiheme, c-type cytochrome MmcA was higher in 
      AQDS-respiring cells than in cells performing methylotrophic methanogenesis. A 
      strain in which the gene for MmcA was deleted failed to grow via AQDS reduction 
      but grew with the conversion of methanol or acetate to methane, suggesting that 
      MmcA has a specialized role as a conduit for extracellular electron transfer. 
      Enhanced expression of genes for methanol conversion to methyl-coenzyme M and the 
      Rnf complex suggested that methanol is oxidized to carbon dioxide in 
      AQDS-respiring cells through a pathway that is similar to methyl-coenzyme M 
      oxidation in methanogenic cells. However, during AQDS respiration the Rnf complex 
      and reduced methanophenazine probably transfer electrons to MmcA, which functions 
      as the terminal reductase for AQDS reduction. Extracellular electron transfer may 
      enable the survival of methanogens in dynamic environments in which oxidized 
      humic substances and Fe(III) oxides are intermittently available. The 
      availability of tools for genetic manipulation of M. acetivorans makes it an 
      excellent model microbe for evaluating c-type cytochrome-dependent extracellular 
      electron transfer in ArchaeaIMPORTANCE The discovery of a methanogen that can 
      conserve energy to support growth solely from the oxidation of organic carbon 
      coupled to the reduction of an extracellular electron acceptor expands the 
      possible environments in which methanogens might thrive. The potential importance 
      of c-type cytochromes for extracellular electron transfer to syntrophic bacterial 
      partners and/or Fe(III) minerals in some Archaea was previously proposed, but 
      these studies with Methanosarcina acetivorans provide the first genetic evidence 
      for cytochrome-based extracellular electron transfer in Archaea The results 
      suggest parallels with Gram-negative bacteria, such as Shewanella and Geobacter 
      species, in which multiheme outer-surface c-type cytochromes are an essential 
      component for electrical communication with the extracellular environment. M. 
      acetivorans offers an unprecedented opportunity to study mechanisms for energy 
      conservation from the anaerobic oxidation of one-carbon organic compounds coupled 
      to extracellular electron transfer in Archaea with implications not only for 
      methanogens but possibly also for Archaea that anaerobically oxidize methane.

AB  - Various carbon sources as substrates and electron donors can produce methane via 
      different metabolic pathways. In particular, the methane produced by rice 
      cultivation has a severe impact on climate change. However, how Fe(3+), the most 
      abundant oxide in paddy soil, mediates the methanogenesis of different carbon 
      sources is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of four carbon 
      sources with different chain lengths (acetate, glucose, nonanoate, and starch) on 
      CH(4) production and associated methanogens in iron-rich paddy soil over 90 days 
      of anaerobic incubation. We found that glucose and starch were the more 
      preferential substrates for liberating methane compared to acetate, and the rate 
      was also faster. Nonanoate was unable to support methane production. 
      Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales were the most predominant methanogenic 
      archaea as shown by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, though their abundance changed over 
      time. Additionally, a significantly higher content of iron-reducing bacteria was 
      observed in the glucose and starch treatments, and it was significantly 
      positively correlated with the copy number of the methanogenic mcrA gene. 
      Together, we confirmed the methanogenic capacity of different carbon sources and 
      their related microorganisms. We also showed that iron oxides play a central role 
      in regulating methane emissions from paddy soils and need more attention to be 
      paid to them.

AB  - Fats, oil and grease (FOG) are energy-dense wastes that substantially increase 
      biomethane recovery. Shifts in the microbial community during anaerobic 
      co-digestion of FOG was assessed to understand relationships between substrate 
      digestion and microbial adaptations. Excessive addition of FOG inhibited the 
      methanogenic activity during initial phase; however, it enhanced the ultimate 
      methane production by 217% compared to the control. The dominance of 
      Proteobacteria was decreased with a simultaneous increase in Firmicutes, 
      Bacteriodetes, Synergistetes and Euryarchaeota during the co-digestion. A 
      significant increase in Syntrophomonas (0.18-11%), Sporanaerobacter (0.14-6%) and 
      Propionispira (0.02-19%) was observed during co-digestion, which substantiated 
      their importance in acetogenesis. Among methanogenic Archaea, the dominance of 
      Methanosaeta (94%) at the beginning of co-digestion was gradually replaced by 
      Methanosarcina (0.52-95%). The absence/relatively low abundance of syntrophic 
      acetate oxidizers and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and dominance of acetoclastic 
      methanogens suggested that methane generation during co-digestion of FOG was 
      predominantly conducted through acetoclastic pathway led by Methanosarcina.

AB  - Different inoculum to slaughterhouse waste (SHW) ratios (Ino/SHW) influences the 
      digester performance, substrate utilization, and methane yield through microbial 
      shift and their metabolic syntrophy. Acetoclastic Methanosarcina (68-87%) was 
      dominant in the exponential phase, overpowering the initial abundance of 
      Methanosaeta (86% of methanogens) in the SHW digesters. Positive interactions 
      among acetogenic and acetate-oxidizing species of Clostridium (11%) with 
      Methanosarcina (84% of methanogens) improved the methanogenic activity 
      (292 mL g(-1) VS(initial) d(-1)) and final VS utilization (90%) at the highest 
      Ino/SHW loading. In contrast, significant improvement of methane yield (152% 
      higher than the control) at the lowest Ino/SHW loading was attributed to strong 
      syntrophy among Methanosaeta (24% of methanogens) and its exoelectrogenic 
      partners, Bythopirellula (0.52%) and Mariniphaga (0.08%) and the acetogenic 
      Cloacimonas (0.16%) and Longilinea (0.32%). These syntrophic interactions among 
      the core microbiota induced major metabolic activities, including butanoate, 
      glycine, serine and threonine, methane, propanoate, and pyruvate metabolism, and 
      quorum sensing.

TI  - The Methanosarcina acetivorans thioredoxin system activates DNA binding of the 
      redox-sensitive transcriptional regulator MsvR.
PG  - 965-9
LID - 10.1007/s10295-015-1592-y [doi]
AB  - The production of biogas (methane) by an anaerobic digestion is an important 
      facet to renewable energy, but is subject to instability due to the sensitivity 
      of strictly anaerobic methanogenic archaea (methanogens) to environmental 
      perturbations, such as oxygen. An understanding of the oxidant-sensing mechanisms 
      used by methanogens may lead to the development of more oxidant tolerant (i.e., 
      stable) methanogen strains. MsvR is a redox-sensitive transcriptional regulator 
      that is found exclusively in methanogens. We show here that oxidation of MsvR 
      from Methanosarcina acetivorans (MaMsvR) with hydrogen peroxide oxidizes cysteine 
      thiols, which inactivates MaMsvR binding to its own promoter (P(msvR)). 
      Incubation of oxidized MaMsvR with the M. acetivorans thioredoxin system (NADPH, 
      MaTrxR, and MaTrx7) results in reduction of the cysteines back to thiols and 
      activation of P msvR binding. These data confirm that cysteines are critical for 
      the thiol-disulfide regulation of P(msvR) binding by MaMsvR and support a role 
      for the M. acetivorans thioredoxin system in the in vivo activation of MaMsvR. 
      The results support the feasibility of using MaMsvR and P(msvR), along with the 
      Methanosarcina genetic system, to design methanogen strains with 
      oxidant-regulated gene expression systems, which may aid in stabilizing anaerobic 
      digestion.

TI  - In vitro methanol production from methyl coenzyme M using the Methanosarcina 
      barkeri MtaABC protein complex.
PG  - 1243-1249
LID - 10.1002/btpr.2503 [doi]
AB  - Methanol:coenzyme M methyltransferase is an enzyme complex composed of three 
      subunits, MtaA, MtaB, and MtaC, found in methanogenic archaea and is needed for 
      their growth on methanol ultimately producing methane. MtaABC catalyzes the 
      energetically favorable methyl transfer from methanol to coenzyme M to form 
      methyl coenzyme M. Here we demonstrate that this important reaction for possible 
      production of methanol from the anaerobic oxidation of methane can be reversed in 
      vitro. To this effect, we have expressed and purified the Methanosarcina barkeri 
      MtaABC enzyme, and developed an in vitro functional assay that demonstrates 
      MtaABC can catalyze the energetically unfavorable (ΔG° = 27 kJ/mol) reverse 
      reaction starting from methyl coenzyme M and generating methanol as a product. 
      Demonstration of an in vitro ability of MtaABC to produce methanol may ultimately 
      enable the anaerobic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and from methanol 
      alternative fuel or fuel-precursor molecules. © 2017 American Institute of

AB  - Ammonia is a ubiquitous potential inhibitor of anaerobic digestion processes, 
      mainly exhibiting inhibition towards methanogenic activity. However, knowledge as 
      to how ammonia affects the methanogens is still limited. In this study, we 
      cultured a multitrophic methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri DSM 800, with acetate, 
      H(2)/CO(2), and methanol to evaluate the influence of ammonia on different 
      methanogenic pathways. Aceticlastic methanogenesis was more sensitive to 
      increased ammonia concentrations than hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic 
      methanogenesis. Theoretical maximum NH(3) tolerances of M. barkeri fed with 
      acetate, H(2)/CO(2), and methanol were calculated to be 39.1 ± 9.0, 104.3 ± 7.4, 
      and 85.7 ± 1.0 mg/L, respectively. The order of the ΔG range of M. barkeri under 
      three methanogenic pathways reflected the order of ammonia tolerance of M. 
      barkeri. Our results provide insights into the role of the thermodynamic 
      potential of methanogenesis on the tolerance of ammonia stress; and shed light on 
      the mechanism of ammonia inhibition on anaerobic digestion.

TI  - Methanogens acquire and bioaccumulate nickel during reductive dissolution of 
      nickelian pyrite.
PG  - e0099123

LID - e00991-23
AB  - Nickel (Ni) is a key component of the active site metallocofactors of numerous 
      enzymes required for methanogenesis, including [NiFe]-hydrogenase, carbon 
      monoxide dehydrogenase, and methyl CoM reductase, leading to a high demand for Ni 
      among methanogens. However, methanogens often inhabit euxinic environments that 
      favor the sequestration of nickel as metal-sulfide minerals, such as nickelian 
      pyrite [(Ni,Fe)S(2)], that have low solubilities and that are not considered 
      bioavailable. Recently, however, several different model methanogens 
      (Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanococcus voltae, Methanococcus maripaludis) were 
      shown to reductively dissolve pyrite (FeS(2)) and to utilize dissolution products 
      to meet iron and sulfur biosynthetic demands. Here, using M. barkeri Fusaro, and 
      laboratory-synthesized (Ni,Fe)S(2) that was physically isolated from cells using 
      dialysis membranes, we show that trace nickel (<20 nM) abiotically solubilized 
      from the mineral can support methanogenesis and limited growth, roughly fivefold 
      less than the minimum concentration known to support methanogenesis. Furthermore, 
      when provided direct contact with (Ni,Fe)S(2), M. barkeri promoted the reductive 
      dissolution of (Ni,Fe)S(2) and assimilated solubilized nickel, iron, and sulfur 
      as its sole source of these elements. Cells that reductively dissolved 
      (Ni,Fe)S(2) bioaccumulated approximately fourfold more nickel than those grown 
      with soluble nickel and sulfide but had similar metabolic coupling efficiencies. 
      While the mechanism for Ni uptake in archaeal methanogens is not known, homologs 
      of the bacterial Nik uptake system were shown to be ubiquitous across methanogen 
      genomes. Collectively, these observations indicate that (Ni,Fe)S(2) is 
      bioavailable in anoxic environments and that methanogens can convert this mineral 
      into nickel-, iron-, and sulfur-containing metalloenzymes to support 
      methanogenesis and growth. IMPORTANCE Nickel is an essential metal, and its 
      availability has changed dramatically over Earth history due to shifts in the 
      predominant type of volcanism in the late Archean that limited its availability 
      and an increase in euxinic conditions in the early Proterozoic that favored its 
      precipitation as nickel sulfide minerals. Observations presented herein indicate 
      that the methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri, can acquire nickel at low 
      concentration (<20 nM) from soluble and mineral sources. Furthermore, M. barkeri 
      was shown to actively reduce nickelian pyrite; use dissolution products to meet 
      their iron, sulfur, and nickel demands; and bioaccumulate nickel. These data help 
      to explain how M. barkeri (and possibly other methanogens and anaerobes) can 
      acquire nickel in contemporary and past anoxic or euxinic environments.

AB  - A mesophilic anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was operated to evaluate 
      the effect of sulfate addition on methane production and sulfate reduction using 
      acetate as the sole carbon source. The results show that at the organic loading 
      rate of 4.0 g TOC/L/day, the TOC removal efficiencies and the biogas production 
      rates achieved over 95 % and 7000 mL/L/day without sulfate, respectively, and 
      slightly decreased with sulfate addition (500-800 mg/L). Methane production 
      capacities were not influenced significantly with the addition of sulfate, while 
      sulfate reduction efficiencies were not stable with 23-87 % in the acetate-fed 
      reactor. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to analyze the 
      functional microbial compositions of acetate-degrading methane-producing bacteria 
      (MPB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the reactor. The results found that 
      as the increase of sulfate concentration, the proportion of Methanomicrobiales 
      increased up to 58 ± 2 %, while Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina decreased. The 
      dominant methanogens shifted into hydrogenotrophic methanogens from even 
      distribution of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. When 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant, sulfate reduction efficiency was 
      high, while sulfate reduction efficiency was low as acetoclastic methanogens were 
      dominant.

AB  - Heterodisulfide reductases (Hdr) of the HdrABC class are ancient enzymes and a 
      component of the anaerobic core belonging to the prokaryotic common ancestor. The 
      ancient origin is consistent with the widespread occurrence of genes encoding 
      putative HdrABC homologs in metabolically diverse prokaryotes predicting diverse 
      physiological functions; however, only one HdrABC has been characterized and that 
      was from a narrow metabolic group of obligate CO(2)-reducing methanogenic 
      anaerobes (methanogens) from the domain Archaea Here we report the biochemical 
      characterization of an HdrABC homolog (HdrA2B2C2) from the acetate-utilizing 
      methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans with unusual properties structurally and 
      functionally distinct from the only other HdrABC characterized. Homologs of the 
      HdrA2B2C2 archetype are present in phylogenetically and metabolically diverse 
      species from the domains Bacteria and Archaea The expression of the individual 
      HdrA2, HdrB2, and HdrB2C2 enzymes in Escherichia coli, and reconstitution of an 
      active HdrA2B2C2 complex, revealed an intersubunit electron transport pathway 
      dependent on ferredoxin or coenzyme F(420) (F(420)H(2)) as an electron donor. 
      Remarkably, HdrA2B2C2 couples the previously unknown endergonic oxidation of 
      F(420)H(2) and reduction of ferredoxin with the exergonic oxidation of F(420)H(2) 
      and reduction of the heterodisulfide of coenzyme M and coenzyme B (CoMS-SCoB). 
      The unique electron bifurcation predicts a role for HdrA2B2C2 in 
      Fe(III)-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (ANME) by M. acetivorans and 
      uncultured species from ANME environments. HdrA2B2C2, ubiquitous in acetotrophic 
      methanogens, was shown to participate in electron transfer during acetotrophic 
      growth of M. acetivorans and proposed to be essential for growth in the 
      environment when acetate is limiting. IMPORTANCE: Discovery of the archetype 
      HdrA2B2C2 heterodisulfide reductase with categorically unique properties extends 
      the understanding of this ancient family beyond CO(2)-reducing methanogens to 
      include diverse prokaryotes from the domains Bacteria and Archaea The 
      unprecedented coenzyme F(420)-dependent electron bifurcation, an emerging 
      fundamental principle of energy conservation, predicts a role for HdrA2B2C2 in 
      diverse metabolisms, including anaerobic CH(4)-oxidizing pathways. The results 
      document an electron transport role for HdrA2B2C2 in acetate-utilizing 
      methanogens responsible for at least two-thirds of the methane produced in 
      Earth's biosphere. The previously unavailable heterologous production of 
      individual subunits and the reconstitution of HdrA2B2C2 with activity have 
      provided an understanding of intersubunit electron transfer in the HdrABC class 
      and a platform for investigating the principles of electron bifurcation.

      may be an important sink of CH4 derived from waste fermentation. To show evidence 
      of AMO and to uncover function anaerobic methanotroph (ANME) community in 
      landfill, different age waste samples were collected in Jinqianpu landfill 
      located in north China. Through high-throughput sequencing, Methanomicrobiales 
      and Methanosarcinales archaea associated with ANME and reverse methanogenic 
      archaea of Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium were detected. Sulfate-reducing 
      bacteria (SRB) (Desulfobulbus and Desulfococcus) which could couple with 
      ANME-conducting AMO were also found. But, the community structure of ANME had no 
      significant difference with depths. From the results of investigation, we can 
      come to a conclusion that sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (SR-DAMO) 
      would be the dominant AMO process in the landfill, while iron-dependent anaerobic 
      methane oxidation (M/IR-DAMO) process was weak though concentration of ferric 
      iron was large in the landfill. Denitrification-dependent anaerobic methane 
      oxidation (NR-DAMO) was negative because of lack of nitrate and relevant function 
      microorganisms in the landfill. Results also indicate that CH4 mitigation would 
      have higher potential by increasing electron acceptor contents and promoting the 
      growth of relevant function microorganisms.

TI  - Cold Seeps on the Passive Northern U.S. Atlantic Margin Host Globally 
      Representative Members of the Seep Microbiome with Locally Dominant Strains of 
      Archaea.

AB  - Marine cold seeps are natural sites of methane emission and harbor distinct 
      microbial communities capable of oxidizing methane. The majority of known cold 
      seeps are on tectonically active continental margins, but recent discoveries have 
      revealed abundant seeps on passive margins as well, including on the U.S. 
      Atlantic Margin (USAM). We sampled in and around four USAM seeps and combined 
      pore water geochemistry measurements with amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and 
      mcrA (DNA and RNA) to investigate the microbial communities present, their 
      assembly processes, and how they compare to communities at previously studied 
      sites. We found that the USAM seeps contained communities consistent with the 
      canonical seep microbiome at the class and order levels but differed markedly at 
      the sequence variant level, especially within the anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) 
      archaea. The ANME populations were highly uneven, with just a few dominant mcrA 
      sequence variants at each seep. Interestingly, the USAM seeps did not form a 
      distinct phylogenetic cluster when compared with other previously described seeps 
      around the world. Consistent with this, we found only a very weak (though 
      statistically significant) distance-decay trend in seep community similarity 
      across a global data set. Ecological assembly indices suggest that the USAM seep 
      communities were assembled primarily deterministically, in contrast to the 
      surrounding nonseep sediments, where stochastic processes dominated. Together, 
      our results suggest that the primary driver of seep microbial community 
      composition is local geochemistry-specifically methane, sulfide, nitrate, 
      acetate, and ammonium concentrations-rather than the geologic context, the 
      composition of nearby seeps, or random events of dispersal. IMPORTANCE Cold seeps 
      are now known to be widespread features of passive continental margins, including 
      the northern U.S. Atlantic Margin (USAM). Methane seepage is expected to 
      intensify at these relatively shallow seeps as bottom waters warm and underlying 
      methane hydrates dissociate. While methanotrophic microbial communities might 
      reduce or prevent methane release, microbial communities on passive margins have 
      rarely been characterized. In this study, we investigated the Bacteria and 
      Archaea at four cold seeps on the northern USAM and found that despite being 
      colocated on the same continental slope, the communities significantly differ by 
      site at the sequence variant level, particularly methane-cycling community 
      members. Differentiation by site was not observed in similarly spaced background 
      sediments, raising interesting questions about the dispersal pathways of cold 
      seep microorganisms. Understanding the genetic makeup of these discrete seafloor 
      ecosystems and how their microbial communities develop will be increasingly 
      important as the climate changes.

AB  - For better understanding the role of magnetite in methanation of different 
      substrates, two up-flow anaerobic sludge bed reactors (RM with magnetite; RS with 
      silica) were built using acetate (stage I), propionate + butyrate (stage II), and 
      sucrose (stage III) as the substrates, respectively. RM reactor showed better COD 
      removal efficiency and adaptability to different substrate impacts. More 
      extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were produced for anaerobic sludge 
      granulation, and the sludge in RM had better intensity, hydrophobicity and 
      electroactivity compared with those in RS. Interestingly, magnetite had different 
      promoting effects on methanogenic degradation of different substrates, and 
      magnetite facilitated different syntrophic partners, like Desulfovibrio, 
      Smithella, unidentified Clostridiates and Methanosaeta in different stages. The 
      strengthening factor of biogas production from sucrose was the highest 
      (1.23 ± 0.03), and analysis of key enzyme activities indicated that the potential 
      magnetite-induced direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) improved the 
      process between the glycolysis, oxidation of pyruvate and CO(2)-dependent 
      methanogenesis.

PG  - 4699-710
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7436-5 [doi]
AB  - Degradation of biomass in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors via 
      anaerobic digestion involves a syntrophic association of a plethora of anaerobic 
      microorganisms. The commercial application of this process is the large-scale 
      production of biogas from renewable feedstock as an alternative to fossil fuels. 
      After hydrolysis of polymers, monomers are fermented to short-chain fatty acids 
      and alcohols, which are further oxidized to acetate. Carbon dioxide, molecular 
      hydrogen (H2), and acetate generated during the process are converted to methane 
      by methanogenic archaea. Since many of the metabolic pathways as well as the 
      syntrophic interactions and dependencies during anaerobic digestion involve 
      formation, utilization, or transfer of H2, its metabolism and the methanogenic 
      population were assessed in various samples from three commercial biogas plants. 
      Addition of H2 significantly increased the rate of methane formation, which 
      suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is not a rate-limiting step during 
      biogas formation. Methanoculleus and Methanosarcina appeared to numerically 
      dominate the archaeal population of the three digesters, but their proportion and 
      the Bacteria-to-Archaea ratio did not correlate with the methane productivity. 
      Instead, hydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts from digester sludge 
      correlated with methane productivity in a positive fashion. Since most 
      microorganisms involved in biogas formation contain this activity, it 
      approximates the overall anaerobic metabolic activity and may, thus, be suitable 
      for monitoring biogas reactor performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are hotspots for productivity and 
      biodiversity. Thermal pyrolysis and circulation produce fluids rich in 
      hydrocarbons and reduced compounds that stimulate microbial activity in 
      surrounding sediments. Several studies have characterized the diversity of 
      Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) sediment-inhabiting microorganisms; however, 
      many of the identified taxa lack cultures or genomic representations. Here, we 
      resolved the metabolic potential and community-level interactions of these 
      diverse communities by reconstructing and analyzing microbial genomes from 
      metagenomic sequencing data. RESULTS: We reconstructed 115 microbial 
      metagenome-assembled genomes comprising 27 distinct archaeal and bacterial phyla. 
      The archaea included members of the DPANN and TACK superphyla, Bathyarchaeota, 
      novel Methanosarcinales (GoM-Arc1), and anaerobic methane-oxidizing lineages 
      (ANME-1). Among the bacterial phyla, members of the Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, 
      and Deltaproteobacteria were metabolically versatile and harbored potential 
      pathways for hydrocarbon and lipid degradation and a variety of respiratory 
      processes. Genes encoding enzymes that activate anaerobic hydrocarbons for 
      degradation were detected in Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Latescibacteria, and 
      KSB1 phyla, while the reconstructed genomes for most candidate bacteria phyla 
      (Aminicenantes, Atribacteria, Omnitrophica, and Stahlbacteria) indicated a 
      fermentative metabolism. Newly obtained GoM-Arc1 archaeal genomes encoded novel 
      pathways for short-chain hydrocarbon oxidation by alkyl-coenzyme M formation. We 
      propose metabolic linkages among different functional groups, such as 
      fermentative community members sharing substrate-level interdependencies with 
      sulfur- and nitrogen-cycling microbes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, inferring the 
      physiologies of archaea and bacteria from metagenome-assembled genomes in 
      hydrothermal deep-sea sediments has revealed potential mechanisms of carbon 
      cycling in deep-sea sediments. Our results further suggest a network of 
      biogeochemical interdependencies in organic matter utilization, hydrocarbon 
      degradation, and respiratory sulfur cycling among deep-sea-inhabiting microbial 
      communities.

AB  - Compositional variations in organic wastes influence microbial abundancy and 
      syntrophy during anaerobic digestion (AD), impacting the normal performance of 
      digesters for methanation. Investigation of the microbial dynamics during AD 
      following augmentation with polysaccharidic wastes (PW) revealed the association 
      of effective digester performance and methane yields with the microbial nexus. 
      Dominance of the acidogenic saccharolytic genera, Prevotella, Eubacterium, and 
      Lachnoclostridium, enhanced the utilization of carbohydrates (54%) in 
      PW-augmented digesters. Spearman's rs correlation showed dynamic interspecies 
      interactions among acetogenic syntrophs, and that of iron oxidizers/reducers with 
      acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Propionate oxidizers in 
      Chloroflexi (i.e., Bellilinea, Levilinea, and Longilinea) exhibited positive 
      associations with acetoclastic methanogens. Increase in the population of 
      acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosaeta, 77% and Methanosarcina, 9%) accelerated 
      the methanogenic activity of PW-augmented digesters by 7 times during the 
      exponential phase, increasing the methane yield (75%) compared to the control. 
      Thus, microbial syntrophy facilitated the effective methanation of PW during AD 
      process.

TI  - Structural Dynamics of the Methyl-Coenzyme M Reductase Active Site Are Influenced 
      by Coenzyme F(430) Modifications.
PG  - 1783-1794
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.4c00168 [doi]
AB  - Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a central player in methane biogeochemistry, 
      governing methanogenesis and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in 
      methanogens and anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME), respectively. The prosthetic 
      group of MCR is coenzyme F(430), a nickel-containing tetrahydrocorphin. Several 
      modified versions of F(430) have been discovered, including the 
      17(2)-methylthio-F(430) (mtF(430)) used by ANME-1 MCR. Here, we employ molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the active site dynamics of MCR from 
      Methanosarcina acetivorans and ANME-1 when bound to the canonical F(430) compared 
      to 17(2)-thioether coenzyme F(430) variants and substrates (methyl-coenzyme M and 
      coenzyme B) for methane formation. Our simulations highlight the importance of 
      the Gln to Val substitution in accommodating the 17(2) methylthio modification in 
      ANME-1 MCR. Modifications at the 17(2) position disrupt the canonical substrate 
      positioning in M. acetivorans MCR. However, in some replicates, active site 
      reorganization to maintain substrate positioning suggests that the modified 
      F(430) variants could be accommodated in a methanogenic MCR. We additionally 
      report the first quantitative estimate of MCR intrinsic electric fields that are 
      pivotal in driving methane formation. Our results suggest that the electric field 
      aligned along the CH(3)-S-CoM thioether bond facilitates homolytic bond cleavage, 
      coinciding with the proposed catalytic mechanism. Structural perturbations, 
      however, weaken and misalign these electric fields, emphasizing the importance of 
      the active site structure in maintaining their integrity. In conclusion, our 
      results deepen the understanding of MCR active site dynamics, the enzyme's 
      organizational role in intrinsic electric fields for catalysis, and the interplay 
      between active site structure and electrostatics.

TI  - Characterization of C1-metabolizing prokaryotic communities in methane seep 
      habitats at the Kuroshima Knoll, southern Ryukyu Arc, by analyzing pmoA, mmoX, 
      mxaF, mcrA, and 16S rRNA genes.
PG  - 7445-55
AB  - Samples from three submerged sites (MC, a core obtained in the methane seep area; 
      MR, a reference core obtained at a distance from the methane seep; and HC, a 
      gas-bubbling carbonate sample) at the Kuroshima Knoll in the southern Ryuku arc 
      were analyzed to gain insight into the organisms present and the processes 
      involved in this oxic-anoxic methane seep environment. 16S rRNA gene analyses by 
      quantitative real-time PCR and clone library sequencing revealed that the MC core 
      sediments contained abundant archaea (approximately 34% of the total 
      prokaryotes), including both mesophilic methanogens related to the genus 
      Methanolobus and ANME-2 members of the Methanosarcinales, as well as members of 
      the delta-Proteobacteria, suggesting that both anaerobic methane oxidation and 
      methanogenesis occurred at this site. In addition, several functional genes 
      connected with methane metabolism were analyzed by quantitative competitive-PCR, 
      including the genes encoding particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA), soluble 
      methane monooxygenase (mmoX), methanol dehydrogenese (mxaF), and methyl coenzyme 
      M reductase (mcrA). In the MC core sediments, the most abundant gene was mcrA 
      (2.5 x 10(6) copies/g [wet weight]), while the pmoA gene of the type I 
      methanotrophs (5.9 x 10(6) copies/g [wet weight]) was most abundant at the 
      surface of the MC core. These results indicate that there is a very complex 
      environment in which methane production, anaerobic methane oxidation, and aerobic 
      methane oxidation all occur in close proximity. The HC carbonate site was rich in 
      gamma-Proteobacteria and had a high copy number of mxaF (7.1 x 10(6) copies/g 
      [wet weight]) and a much lower copy number of the pmoA gene (3.2 x 10(2) copies/g 
      [wet weight]). The mmoX gene was never detected. In contrast, the reference core 
      contained familiar sequences of marine sedimentary archaeal and bacterial groups 
      but not groups specific to C1 metabolism. Geochemical characterization of the 
      amounts and isotopic composition of pore water methane and sulfate strongly 
      supported the notion that in this zone both aerobic methane oxidation and 
      anaerobic methane oxidation, as well as methanogenesis, occur.

TI  - Microbial diversity of hydrothermal sediments in the Guaymas Basin: evidence for 
      anaerobic methanotrophic communities.
PG  - 1994-2007
AB  - Microbial communities in hydrothermally active sediments of the Guaymas Basin 
      (Gulf of California, Mexico) were studied by using 16S rRNA sequencing and carbon 
      isotopic analysis of archaeal and bacterial lipids. The Guaymas sediments 
      harbored uncultured euryarchaeota of two distinct phylogenetic lineages within 
      the anaerobic methane oxidation 1 (ANME-1) group, ANME-1a and ANME-1b, and of the 
      ANME-2c lineage within the Methanosarcinales, both previously assigned to the 
      methanotrophic archaea. The archaeal lipids in the Guaymas Basin sediments 
      included archaeol, diagnostic for nonthermophilic euryarchaeota, and 
      sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol, with the latter compound being particularly abundant in 
      cultured members of the Methanosarcinales. The concentrations of these compounds 
      were among the highest observed so far in studies of methane seep environments. 
      The delta-(13)C values of these lipids (delta-(13)C = -89 to -58 per thousand) 
      indicate an origin from anaerobic methanotrophic archaea. This molecular-isotopic 
      signature was found not only in samples that yielded predominantly ANME-2 clones 
      but also in samples that yielded exclusively ANME-1 clones. ANME-1 archaea 
      therefore remain strong candidates for mediation of the anaerobic oxidation of 
      methane. Based on 16S rRNA data, the Guaymas sediments harbor phylogenetically 
      diverse bacterial populations, which show considerable overlap with bacterial 
      populations of geothermal habitats and natural or anthropogenic hydrocarbon-rich 
      sites. Consistent with earlier observations, our combined evidence from bacterial 
      phylogeny and molecular-isotopic data indicates an important role of some novel 
      deeply branching bacteria in anaerobic methanotrophy. Anaerobic methane oxidation 
      likely represents a significant and widely occurring process in the trophic 
      ecology of methane-rich hydrothermal vents. This study stresses a high diversity 
      among communities capable of anaerobic oxidation of methane.

TI  - Methane-metabolizing microbial communities in sediments of the Haima cold seep 
      area, northwest slope of the South China Sea.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fix101 [doi]
AB  - Cold seeps are widespread chemosynthetic ecosystems in the deep-sea environment, 
      and cold seep microbial communities of the South China Sea are poorly 
      constrained. Here we report on the archaeal communities, particularly those 
      involved in methane metabolization, in sediments of a newly discovered cold seep 
      (named 'Haima') on the northwest slope of the South China Sea. Archaeal 
      diversity, abundance and distribution were investigated in two piston cores 
      collected from a seep area (QDN-14B) and a non-seep control site (QDN-31B). 
      Geochemical investigation of the QDN-14B core identified an estimated 
      sulfate-methane transition zone (Estimated SMTZ) at 300-400 cm below sea floor 
      (cmbsf), where a high abundance of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) 
      occurred, as revealed by analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the gene (mcrA) 
      encoding the α-subunit of the key enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase. ANME-2a/b 
      was predominant in the upper and middle layers of the estimated SMTZ, whereas 
      ANME-1b outcompeted ANME-2 in the sulfate-depleted bottom layers of the estimated 
      SMTZ and the methanogenic zone. Fine-scale phylogenetic analysis further divided 
      the ANME-1b group into three subgroups with different distribution patterns: 
      ANME-1bI, ANME-1bII and ANME-1bIII. Multivariate analyses indicated that 
      dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfate may be important factors controlling the 
      composition of the methane-metabolizing community. Our study on ANME niche 
      separation and interactions with other archaeal groups improves our understanding 
      of the metabolic diversity and flexibility of ANME, and the findings further 
      suggest that ANME subgroups may have evolved diversified/specified metabolic 
      capabilities other than syntrophic anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with 
      sulfate reduction in marine sediments.

AB  - Methanogenic archaea of the genus Methanosarcina possess a unique type of 
      metabolism because they use H(2)+CO(2), methylated C(1)-compounds, or acetate as 
      energy and carbon source for growth. The process of methanogenesis is fundamental 
      for the global carbon cycle and represents the terminal step in the anaerobic 
      breakdown of organic matter in freshwater sediments. Moreover, methane is an 
      important greenhouse gas that directly contributes to climate change and global 
      warming. Methanosarcina species convert the aforementioned substrates to CH(4) 
      via the CO(2)-reducing, the methylotrophic, or the aceticlastic pathway. All 
      methanogenic processes finally result in the oxidation of two thiol-containing 
      cofactors (HS-CoM and HS-CoB), leading to the formation of the so-called 
      heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-CoB) that contains an intermolecular disulfide bridge. 
      This molecule functions as the terminal electron acceptor of a branched 
      respiratory chain. Molecular hydrogen, reduced coenzyme F(420), or reduced 
      ferredoxin are used as electron donors. The key enzymes of the respiratory chain 
      (Ech hydrogenase, F(420)-nonreducing hydrogenase, F(420)H(2) dehydrogenase, and 
      heterodisulfide reductase) couple the redox reactions to proton translocation 
      across the cytoplasmic membrane. The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is 
      the driving force for ATP synthesis. Here, we describe the methods and techniques 
      of how to analyze electron transfer reactions, the process of proton 
      translocation, and the formation of ATP.

      methanogens.
PG  - 1954-66

AB  - Syntrophic bacteria drive the anaerobic degradation of certain fermentation 
      products (e.g., butyrate, ethanol, propionate) to intermediary substrates (e.g., 
      H2, formate, acetate) that yield methane at the ecosystem level. However, little 
      is known about the in situ activities and identities of these syntrophs in 
      peatlands, ecosystems that produce significant quantities of methane. The 
      consumption of butyrate, ethanol or propionate by anoxic peat slurries at 5 and 
      15 °C yielded methane and CO2 as the sole accumulating products, indicating that 
      the intermediates H2, formate and acetate were scavenged effectively by 
      syntrophic methanogenic consortia. 16S rRNA stable isotope probing identified 
      novel species/strains of Pelobacter and Syntrophomonas that syntrophically 
      oxidized ethanol and butyrate, respectively. Propionate was syntrophically 
      oxidized by novel species of Syntrophobacter and Smithella, genera that use 
      different propionate-oxidizing pathways. Taxa not known for a syntrophic 
      metabolism may have been involved in the oxidation of butyrate 
      (Telmatospirillum-related) and propionate (unclassified Bacteroidetes and 
      unclassified Fibrobacteres). Gibbs free energies (ΔGs) for syntrophic oxidations 
      of ethanol and butyrate were more favorable than ΔGs for syntrophic oxidation of 
      propionate. As a result of the thermodynamic constraints, acetate transiently 
      accumulated in ethanol and butyrate treatments but not in propionate treatments. 
      Aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta) appeared to outnumber 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanocella, Methanoregula), reinforcing the 
      likely importance of aceticlastic methanogenesis to the overall production of 
      methane. ΔGs for acetogenesis from H2 to CO2 approximated to -20 kJ mol(-1) when 
      acetate concentrations were low, indicating that acetogens may have contributed 
      to the flow of carbon and reductant towards methane.

AB  - The understanding and enrichment of consortia formed by syntrophic 
      butyrate-oxidizing bacteria and methanogens in the complex environment are 
      crucial for effectively degrading butyrate and preventing acid inhibition. In 
      this study, the better butyrate-tolerated and highly efficient microbial 
      consortia were domesticated and enriched through adding butyric acid ranging from 
      0.2 to 4.4 g/(L·d). The volumetric biogas production continuously increased to 
      1.65 L/(L·d). Microbial community diversity showed that a dramatic shift of 
      bacterial structure occurred at BAL of 1.6 g/(L·d) and the structure presented 
      better stability at high BAL. The syntrophic consortia and the main metabolic 
      pathways were revealed through combination of the 16S rDNA and metagenome 
      sequencing analyses. Syntrophomonas was the major butyrate-oxidizing bacterium 
      and oxidized butyrate mainly through β-oxidaiton. Synergistaceae and Mesotoga 
      acted as the main acetate-oxidizing bacteria. IHT and methanogenesis pathways 
      were strongly enhanced by DMER64 and Methanosarcina as the main H(2) carrier and 
      dominant methanogen, respectively.

PG  - 11712-11725

AB  - Methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the last step in the biological 
      production of methane by methanogenic archaea, as well as the first step in the 
      anaerobic oxidation of methane to methanol by methanotrophic archaea. MCR 
      contains a number of unique post-translational modifications in its α subunit, 
      including thioglycine, 1-N-methylhistidine, S-methylcysteine, 
      5-C-(S)-methylarginine, and 2-C-(S)-methylglutamine. Recently, genes responsible 
      for the thioglycine and methylarginine modifications have been identified in 
      bioinformatics studies and in vivo complementation of select mutants; however, 
      none of these reactions has been verified in vitro Herein, we purified and 
      biochemically characterized the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein 
      MaMmp10, the product of the methanogenesis marker protein 10 gene in the 
      methane-producing archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans Using an array of 
      approaches, including kinetic assays, LC-MS-based quantification, and MALDI 
      TOF-TOF MS analyses, we found that MaMmp10 catalyzes the methylation of the 
      equivalent of Arg(285) in a peptide substrate surrogate, but only in the presence 
      of cobalamin. We noted that the methyl group derives from SAM, with cobalamin 
      acting as an intermediate carrier, and that MaMmp10 contains a C-terminal 
      cobalamin-binding domain. Given that Mmp10 has not been annotated as a 
      cobalamin-binding protein, these findings suggest that cobalamin-dependent 
      radical SAM proteins are more prevalent than previously thought.

TI  - Potential Activity of Subglacial Microbiota Transported to Anoxic River Delta 
      Sediments.

AB  - The Watson River drains a portion of the SW Greenland ice sheet, transporting 
      microbial communities from subglacial environments to a delta at the head of 
      Søndre Strømfjord. This study investigates the potential activity and community 
      shifts of glacial microbiota deposited and buried under layers of sediments 
      within the river delta. A long-term (12-month) incubation experiment was 
      established using Watson River delta sediment under anaerobic conditions, with 
      and without CO(2)/H(2) enrichment. Within CO(2)/H(2)-amended incubations, 
      sulphate depletion and a shift in the microbial community to a 52% predominance 
      of Desulfosporosinus meridiei by day 371 provides evidence for sulphate 
      reduction. We found evidence of methanogenesis in CO(2)/H(2)-amended incubations 
      within the first 5 months, with production rates of ~4 pmol g(-1) d(-1), which 
      was likely performed by methanogenic Methanomicrobiales- and 
      Methanosarcinales-related organisms. Later, a reduction in methane was observed 
      to be paired with the depletion of sulphate, and we hypothesise that sulphate 
      reduction out competed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The structure and 
      diversity of the original CO(2)/H(2)-amended incubation communities changed 
      dramatically with a major shift in predominant community members and a decline in 
      diversity and cell abundance. These results highlight the need for further 
      investigations into the fate of subglacial microbiota within downstream 
      environments.

AB  - The nutrient and oxygen gradient present in marine sediments promotes high levels 
      of microbial diversity. We applied metagenomics and biogeochemical tools to 
      analyze microbial communities in different sediment depths (0-4 m below sea 
      floor, mbsf) from Guanabara Bay, Brazil, a brackish tropical ecosystem with a 
      history of massive anthropogenic impacts, and a largely unknown sediment 
      microbial diversity. Methanogens (e.g. Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales) 
      were more abundant at 1 mbsf, while sulphate-reducing microbes 
      (Desulfurococcales, Thermoprotales, and Sulfolobales) were more abundant at 
      deeper layers (4 mbsf; corresponding to 3 K Radiocarbon years before present, 
      Holocene Epoch). Taxonomic analyzes and functional gene identification associated 
      with anaerobic methane oxidation (e.g. monomethylamine methyltransferase (mtmB), 
      trimethylamine methyltransferase (mttB) and CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase 
      delta subunit) and sulfate reduction indicated the dominance of Campylobacteria 
      (Sulfurimonas) at deeper sediment layers. Gene sequences related to assimilation 
      of inorganic sulfur increased with depth, while organic sulfur related sequences 
      decrease, accompanying the clear reduction in the concentration of sulfur, 
      organic carbon and chla torwards deeper layers. Analyzes of metagenome assembled 
      genomes also led to the discovery of a novel order within the phylum 
      Acidobacteriota, named Guanabacteria. This novel order had several in silico 
      phenotyping features that differentiate it from closely related phylogenetic 
      neighbors (e.g. Acidobacteria, Aminicenantes, and Thermoanaerobaculum), including 
      several genes (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CO dehydrogenase/CO-methylating 
      acetyl-CoA synthase complex subunit beta, heterodisulfide reductase, sulfite 
      exporter TauE/SafE family protein, sulfurtransferase) that relevant for the S and 
      C cycles. Furthermore, the recovered Bathyarchaeota genome SS9 illustrates the 
      methanogenic potential in deeper sediment layer.

TI  - Lactate oxidation is linked to energy conservation and to oxygen detoxification

AB  - The marine archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans contains a putative 
      NAD (+) -independent d-lactate dehydrogenase (D-iLDH/glycolate oxidase) encoded 
      by the MA4631 gene, belonging to the FAD-oxidase C superfamily. Nucleotide 
      sequences similar to MA4631 gene, were identified in other methanogens and 
      Firmicutes with >90 and 35-40% identity, respectively. Therefore, the lactate 
      metabolism in M. acetivorans is reported here. Cells subjected to intermittent 
      pulses of oxygen (air-adapted; AA-Ma cells) consumed lactate only in combination 
      with acetate, increasing methane production and biomass yield. In AA-Ma cells 
      incubated with d-lactate plus [(14)C]-l-lactate, the radioactive label was found 
      in methane, CO(2) and glycogen, indicating that lactate metabolism fed both 
      methanogenesis and gluconeogenesis. Moreover, d-lactate oxidation was coupled to 
      O(2)-consumption which was sensitive to HQNO; also, AA-Ma cells showed high 
      transcript levels of gene dld and those encoding subunits A (MA1006) and B 
      (MA1007) of a putative cytochrome bd quinol oxidase, compared to anaerobic 
      control cells. An E. coli mutant deficient in dld complemented with the MA4631 
      gene, grew with d-lactate as carbon source and showed membrane-bound 
      d-lactate:quinone oxidoreductase activity. The product of the MA4631 gene is a 
      FAD-containing monomer showing activity of iLDH with preference to d-lactate. The 
      results suggested that air adapted M. acetivorans is able to co-metabolize 
      lactate and acetate with associated oxygen consumption by triggering the 
      transcription and synthesis of the D-iLDH and a putative cytochrome bd: 
      methanophenazine (quinol) oxidoreductase. Biomass generation and O(2) 
      consumption, suggest a potentially new oxygen detoxification mechanism coupled to 
      energy conservation in this methanogen.

AB  - The ecological roles of microbial communities and how they interact with each 
      other in thermal hydrolysis process (THP) assisted thermophilic anaerobic 
      digestion (THP-AD) reactors remain largely unknown, especially under propionate 
      stress. Two thermophilic THP-AD reactors had methane yield of 240-248 mL/g 
      VS(added), but accumulated approximately 2000 mg/L propionate. Genome-centric 
      metagenomics analysis showed that 68 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were 
      recovered, 32 MAGs of which were substantially enriched. Firmicutes spp. 
      dominated the enriched microbial community, including hydrolytic/fermentative 
      bacteria and syntrophs. Methanogenic activities were mainly mediated by 
      Methanosarcina sp. and Methanothermobacter spp. In addition to hydrogenotrophic 
      methanogens, Thermodesulfovibrio sp. could also be a vital H(2) scavenger, 
      contributing to maintaining low H(2) partial pressure in the bioreactors. The 
      remarkable accumulation of propionate could be likely attributed to the weak 
      syntrophic propionate-oxidizing activity or its absence. These findings advanced 
      our knowledge about the mutualistic symbiosis of carbon metabolism in 
      thermophilic THP-AD reactors.

TI  - Cultivation of methanogens from shallow marine sediments at Hydrate Ridge, 
      Oregon.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - Little is known about the methanogenic degradation of acetate, the fate of 
      molecular hydrogen and formate or the ability of methanogens to grow and produce 
      methane in cold, anoxic marine sediments. The microbes that produce methane were 
      examined in permanently cold, anoxic marine sediments at Hydrate Ridge (44 
      degrees 35' N, 125 degrees 10' W, depth 800 m). Sediment samples (15 to 35 cm 
      deep) were collected from areas of active methane ebullition or areas where 
      methane hydrates occurred. The samples were diluted into enrichment medium with 
      formate, acetate or trimethylamine as catabolic substrate. After 2 years of 
      incubation at 4 degrees C to 15 degrees C, enrichment cultures produced methane. 
      PCR amplification and sequencing of the rRNA genes from the highest dilutions 
      with growth suggested that each enrichment culture contained a single strain of 
      methanogen. The level of sequence similarity (91 to 98%) to previously 
      characterized prokaryotes suggested that these methanogens belonged to novel 
      genera or species within the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales. 
      Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene libraries from DNA extracted directly from the 
      sediment samples revealed phylotypes that were either distantly related to 
      cultivated methanogens or possible anaerobic methane oxidizers related to the 
      ANME-1 and ANME-2 groups of the Archaea. However, no methanogenic sequences were 
      detected, suggesting that methanogens represented only a small proportion of the 
      archaeal community.

TI  - Enzymology of the fermentation of acetate to methane by Methanosarcina 
      thermophila.
PG  - 25-35
AB  - Biologically-produced CH4 derives from either the reduction of CO2 or the methyl 
      group of acetate by two separate pathways present in anaerobic mierobes from the 
      Archaea domain. Elucidation of the pathway for CO2 reduction to CH4, the first to 
      be investigated, has yielded several novel enzymes and cofactors. Most of the CH4 
      produced in nature derives from the methyl group of acetate. Methanosarcina 
      thermophila is a moderate thermophile which ferments acetate by reducing the 
      methyl group to CH4 with electrons derived from oxidation of the carbonyl group 
      to CO2. The pathway in M. thermophila is now understood on a biochemical and 
      genetic level comparable to understanding of the CO2-reducing pathway. Enzymes 
      have been purified and characterized. The genes encoding these enzymes have been 
      cloned, sequenced, transcriptionally mapped, and their regulation defined on a 
      molecular level. This review emphasizes recent developments concerning the 
      enzymes which are unique to the acetate fermentation pathway in M. thermophila.

AB  - Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and produced mainly by methanogens. Few 
      studies have specifically dealt so far with methanogens in estuarine 
      environments. In this study, diversity and distribution of methanogens were 
      investigated by clone library and T-RFLP analysis in a Jiulong River estuarine 
      sediment core which contained clear sulfate-methane-transition zone. The majority 
      of obtained sequences in clone libraries and T-RF peaks from T-RFLP analysis were 
      assigned mainly to Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales/ANME. 
      The fragments of Methanosarcinales/ANME were most dominant group (mean 51 %) and 
      composed largely of ANME-2a. In addition, Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobiales 
      accounted for 21 and 28 % of all fragments. Therefore, the presence of 
      Methanomicrobiales, Methanosaeta and ANME-2a was indicative of acetoclastic 
      methanogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and anaerobic methane oxidation 
      in Jiulong River estuarine sediments. This study provided the important knowledge 
      towards understanding methane cycling association of representative of 
      methanogens involved in estuarine environments.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion coupled with bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising 
      approach for biogas upgrading with low energy input. However, the alkalinity 
      generation from electromethanogenesis is invariably ignored which could serve as 
      a potential assistant for CO(2) removal through the transformation into dissolved 
      inorganic carbon (DIC). Herein, a novel bioelectrochemical CO(2) conversion in 
      the methanogenic BES was proposed based on active CO(2) capture and in-situ 
      microbial utilization. It was found that the BES using a stainless steel/carbon 
      felt hybrid biocathode (BES-SSCF reactor) achieved a CH(4) yield of 
      0.33 ± 0.03 LCH(4)/gCOD(removal) and increased CH(4) production rate by 28.3% of 
      BES-CF reactor at 1.0 V applied voltage. As the experiment progressed, CH(4) 
      content increased to 93.1% and CO(2) content in the upgraded biogas maintained at 
      below 3%. The continuous proton consumption from H(2) evolution reaction in the 
      hybrid biocathode was capable of creating a slightly alkaline condition in the 
      BES-SSCF reactor and thereby the CO(2) capture as bicarbonate was enhanced 
      through endogenous alkalinity absorption. Microbial community analysis revealed 
      that significant enrichment of Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina at the 
      BES-SSCF cathodic biofilm was favorable for bicarbonate reduction into CH(4) via 
      establishment of H(2)-mediated electron transfer. Consequently, the remained 
      CO(2) and DIC only accounted for 12% of total carbon in the BES-SSCF reactor and 
      the high conversion rate of CO(2) to CH(4) (82.3%) was achieved. These results 
      unraveled an innovative CO(2) utilization mechanism integrating CO(2) absorption 
      with H(2)-mediated electromethanogenesis.

AB  - Methanosarcina acetivorans, considered a strict anaerobic archaeon, was cultured 
      in the presence of 0.4-1% O2 (atmospheric) for at least 6 months to generate 
      air-adapted cells; further, the biochemical mechanisms developed to deal with O2 
      were characterized. Methane production and protein content, as indicators of cell 
      growth, did not change in air-adapted cells respect to cells cultured under 
      anoxia (control cells). In contrast, growth and methane production significantly 
      decreased in control cells exposed for the first time to O2. Production of 
      reactive oxygen species was 50 times lower in air-adapted cells versus control 
      cells, suggesting enhanced anti-oxidant mechanisms that attenuated the O2 
      toxicity. In this regard, (i) the transcripts and activities of superoxide 
      dismutase, catalase and peroxidase significantly increased; and (ii) the 
      thiol-molecules (cysteine + coenzyme M-SH + sulfide) and polyphosphate contents 
      were respectively 2 and 5 times higher in air-adapted cells versus 
      anaerobic-control cells. Long-term cultures (18 days) of air-adapted cells 
      exposed to 2% O2 exhibited the ability to form biofilms. These data indicate that 
      M. acetivorans develops multiple mechanisms to contend with O2 and the associated 
      oxidative stress, as also suggested by genome analyses for some methanogens.

TI  - Structure and function of an unusual flavodoxin from the domain Archaea.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1908578116 [doi]
AB  - Flavodoxins, electron transfer proteins essential for diverse metabolisms in 
      microbes from the domain Bacteria, are extensively characterized. Remarkably, 
      although genomic annotations of flavodoxins are widespread in microbes from the 
      domain Archaea, none have been isolated and characterized. Herein is described 
      the structural, biochemical, and physiological characterization of an unusual 
      flavodoxin (FldA) from Methanosarcina acetivorans, an acetate-utilizing 
      methane-producing microbe of the domain Archaea In contrast to all flavodoxins, 
      FldA is homodimeric, markedly less acidic, and stabilizes an anionic semiquinone. 
      The crystal structure reveals an flavin mononucleotide (FMN) binding site unique 
      from all other flavodoxins that provides a rationale for stabilization of the 
      anionic semiquinone and a remarkably low reduction potentials for both the 
      oxidized/semiquinone (-301 mV) and semiquinone/hydroquinone couples (-464 mV). 
      FldA is up-regulated in acetate-grown versus methanol-grown cells and shown here 
      to substitute for ferredoxin in mediating the transfer of low potential electrons 
      from the carbonyl of acetate to the membrane-bound electron transport chain that 
      generates ion gradients driving ATP synthesis. FldA offers potential advantages 
      over ferredoxin by (i) sparing iron for abundant iron-sulfur proteins essential 
      for acetotrophic growth and (ii) resilience to oxidative damage.

AB  - Accumulating evidences are challenging the paradigm that methane in surface water 
      primarily stems from the anaerobic transformation of organic matters. Yet, the 
      contribution of oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, a dominant species in surface 
      water, to methane production remains unclear. Here we show methanogenesis 
      triggered by the interaction between oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and 
      anaerobic methanogenic archaea. By introducing cyanobacterium Synechocystis 
      PCC6803 and methanogenic archaea Methanosarcina barkeri with the redox cycling of 
      iron, CH(4) production was induced in coculture biofilms through both syntrophic 
      methanogenesis (under anoxic conditions in darkness) and abiotic methanogenesis 
      (under oxic conditions in illumination) during the periodic dark-light cycles. We 
      have further demonstrated CH(4) production by other model oxygenic photosynthetic 
      bacteria from various phyla, in conjunction with different anaerobic methanogenic 
      archaea exhibiting diverse energy conservation modes, as well as various common 
      Fe-species. These findings have revealed an unexpected link between oxygenic 
      photosynthesis and methanogenesis and would advance our understanding of 
      photosynthetic bacteria's ecological role in the global CH(4) cycle. Such 
      light-driven methanogenesis may be widely present in nature.

PG  - 843-53
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06990.x [doi]
AB  - Biochemical studies have revealed two distinct classes of Coenzyme B-Coenzyme M 
      heterodisulfide (CoB-S-S-CoM) reductase (Hdr), a key enzyme required for 
      anaerobic respiration in methane-producing archaea. A cytoplasmic HdrABC enzyme 
      complex is found in most methanogens, whereas a membrane-bound HdrED complex is 
      found exclusively in members of the order Methanosarcinales. Unexpectedly, 
      genomic data indicate that multiple copies of both Hdr classes are found in all 
      sequenced Methanosarcinales genomes. The Methanosarcina acetivorans hdrED1 operon 
      is constitutively expressed and required for viability under all growth 
      conditions examined, consistent with HdrED being the primary Hdr. HdrABC appears 
      to be specifically involved in methylotrophic methanogenesis, based on reduced 
      growth and methanogenesis rates of an hdrA1C1B1 mutant on methylotrophic 
      substrates and downregulation of the genes during growth on acetate. This 
      conclusion is further supported by phylogenetic analysis showing that the 
      presence of hdrA1 in an organism is specifically correlated with the presence of 
      genes for methylotrophic methanogenesis. Examination of mRNA abundance in 
      methanol-grown Delta hdrA1C1B1 strains relative to wild-type revealed 
      upregulation of genes required for synthesis of (di)methylsulfide and for 
      transport and biosynthesis of CoB-SH and CoM-SH, suggesting that the mutant has a 
      defect in electron transfer from ferredoxin to CoB-S-S-CoM that causes cofactor 
      limitation.

TI  - Methanogenic activity in human periodontal pocket.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - Samples of subgingival dental tissues were examined for the presence of 
      methanogenic activities. Using enrichment cultures, methanogenic activities were 
      detected in 9 of 17 individuals. A mesophilic, Gram-positive, irregular coccoid 
      methanogen, which showed close resemblance to a Methanosarcina sp., was isolated 
      from one sample collected from a patient with type IV periodontal pocket (the 
      periodontal pocket is a space bounded by the tooth on one side and by ulcerated 
      epithelium lining the soft tissue wall on the other). The isolate used methanol, 
      methylamine, acetate, and H(2)-CO(2) as the sole source of carbon. However, the 
      isolate was unable to use formate and trimethylamine as growth substrates. The 
      organism had an optimum pH of 6.5 and an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C. The 
      isolate not only used ammonia, but also used nitrate as a nitrogen source. The 
      niche of this methanogen in periodontal pockets may be to carry out terminal 
      oxidation of simple organic compounds such as methanol and acetate produced by 
      other obligate anaerobes present in periodontal pockets. This methanogen may also 
      play a vital role in interspecies hydrogen transfer, as demonstrated by its use 
      of H(2)-CO(2) as a substrate. The isolate produced significant amount of methane 
      in vitro.

PG  - 5685-5694
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9038-x [doi]
AB  - Wetlands contribute to 30% of global methane emissions due to an imbalance 
      between microbial methane production and consumption. Methanogenesis and 
      methanotrophy have mainly been studied separately, and little is known about 
      their potential interactions in aquatic environments. To mimic the interaction 
      between methane producers and oxidizers in the environment, we co-cultivated the 
      methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri with aerobic Methylocystaceae 
      methanotrophs in an oxygen-limited bioreactor using acetate as methanogenic 
      substrate. Methane, acetate, dissolved oxygen, available nitrogen, pH, 
      temperature, and cell density were monitored to follow system stability and 
      activity. Stable reactor operation was achieved for two consecutive periods of 
      2 months. Fluorescence in situ hybridization micrographs indicated close 
      association between both groups of microorganisms. This association suggests that 
      the methanotrophs profit from direct access to the methane that is produced from 
      acetate, while methanogens are protected by the concomitant oxygen consumption of 
      the methanotrophs. This proof of principle study can be used to set up systems to 
      study their responses to environmental changes.

AB  - This investigation evaluated the effectiveness of biochar of different particle 
      sizes in alleviating ammonium (NH4(+)) inhibition (up to 7 g-N/L) during 
      anaerobic digestion of 6 g/L glucose. Compared to the control treatment without 
      biochar addition, treatments that included biochar particles 2-5 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 
      75-150 μm in size reduced the methanization lag phase by 23.9%, 23.8% and 5.9%, 
      respectively, and increased the maximum methane production rate by 47.1%, 23.5% 
      and 44.1%, respectively. These results confirmed that biochar accelerated the 
      initiation of methanization during anaerobic digestion under double inhibition 
      risk from both ammonium and acids. Furthermore, fine biochar significantly 
      promoted the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Comparative analysis on 
      the archaeal and bacterial diversity at the early and later stages of digestion, 
      and in the suspended, biochar loosely bound, and biochar tightly bound fractions 
      suggested that, in suspended fractions, hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium was 
      actively resistant to ammonium. However, acetoclastic Methanosaeta can survive at 
      VFAs concentrations up to 60-80 mmol-C/L by improved affinity to conductive 
      biochar, resulting in the accelerated initiation of acetate degradation. Improved 
      methanogenesis was followed by the colonization of the biochar tightly bound 
      fractions by Methanosarcina. The selection of appropriate biochar particles sizes 
      was important in facilitating the initial colonization of microbial cells.

TI  - Procaryotic Diversity and Hydrogenotrophic Methanogenesis in an Alkaline Spring 
      (La Crouen, New Caledonia).
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9071360 [doi]
LID - 1360
AB  - (1) Background: The geothermal spring of La Crouen (New Caledonia) discharges 
      warm (42 °C) alkaline water (pH~9) enriched in dissolved nitrogen with traces of 
      methane, but its microbial diversity has not yet been studied. (2) Methods: 
      Cultivation-dependent and -independent methods (e.g., Illumina sequencing and 
      quantitative PCR based on 16S rRNA gene) were used to describe the prokaryotic 
      diversity of this spring. (3) Results: Prokaryotes were mainly represented by 
      Proteobacteria (57% on average), followed by Cyanobacteria, Chlorofexi, and 
      Candidatus Gracilibacteria (GN02/BD1-5) (each > 5%). Both potential aerobes and 
      anaerobes, as well as mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, were 
      identified. Some of them had previously been detected in continental 
      hyperalkaline springs found in serpentinizing environments (The Cedars, Samail, 
      Voltri, and Zambales ophiolites). Gammaproteobacteria, Ca. Gracilibacteria and 
      Thermotogae were significantly more abundant in spring water than in sediments. 
      Potential chemolithotrophs mainly included beta- and gammaproteobacterial genera 
      of sulfate-reducers (Ca. Desulfobacillus), methylotrophs (Methyloversatilis), 
      sulfur-oxidizers (Thiofaba, Thiovirga), or hydrogen-oxidizers (Hydrogenophaga). 
      Methanogens (Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales) were the dominant Archaea, 
      as found in serpentinization-driven and deep subsurface ecosystems. A novel 
      alkaliphilic hydrogenotrophic methanogen (strain CAN) belonging to the genus 
      Methanobacterium was isolated, suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 
      occurs at La Crouen.

TI  - Macroscopic biofilms in fracture-dominated sediment that anaerobically oxidize 
      methane.
PG  - 6780-7
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00288-11 [doi]
AB  - Methane release from seafloor sediments is moderated, in part, by the anaerobic 
      oxidation of methane (AOM) performed by consortia of archaea and bacteria. These 
      consortia occur as isolated cells and aggregates within the sulfate-methane 
      transition (SMT) of diffusion and seep-dominant environments. Here we report on a 
      new SMT setting where the AOM consortium occurs as macroscopic pink to orange 
      biofilms within subseafloor fractures. Biofilm samples recovered from the Indian 
      and northeast Pacific Oceans had a cellular abundance of 10(7) to 10(8) cells 
      cm(-3). This cell density is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that in the 
      surrounding sediments. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes indicated that the 
      bacterial component is dominated by Deltaproteobacteria, candidate division WS3, 
      and Chloroflexi, representing 46%, 15%, and 10% of clones, respectively. In 
      addition, major archaeal taxa found in the biofilm were related to the ANME-1 
      clade, Thermoplasmatales, and Desulfurococcales, representing 73%, 11%, and 10% 
      of archaeal clones, respectively. The sequences of all major taxa were similar to 
      sequences previously reported from cold seep environments. PhyloChip microarray 
      analysis detected all bacterial phyla identified by the clone library plus an 
      additional 44 phyla. However, sequencing detected more archaea than the PhyloChip 
      within the phyla of Methanosarcinales and Desulfurococcales. The stable carbon 
      isotope composition of the biofilm from the SMT (-35 to -43‰) suggests that the 
      production of the biofilm is associated with AOM. These biofilms are a novel, but 
      apparently widespread, aggregation of cells represented by the ANME-1 clade that 
      occur in methane-rich marine sediments.

AB  - Methanogenesis, a biological process mediated by complex microbial communities, 
      has attracted great attention due to its contribution to global warming and 
      potential in biotechnological applications. The current study unveiled the core 
      microbial methanogenic metabolisms in anaerobic vessel ecosystems by applying 
      combined genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Here, we 
      demonstrate that an enriched natural system, fueled only with acetate, could 
      support a bacteria-dominated microbiota employing a multi-trophic methanogenic 
      process. Moreover, significant changes, in terms of microbial structure and 
      function, were recorded after the system was supplemented with additional H(2). 
      Methanosarcina thermophila, the predominant methanogen prior to H(2) addition, 
      simultaneously performed acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic, and methylotrophic 
      methanogenesis. The methanogenic pattern changed after the addition of H(2), 
      which immediately stimulated Methanomicrobia-activity and was followed by a slow 
      enrichment of Methanobacteria members. Interestingly, the essential genes 
      involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were not expressed in bacterial members. 
      The high expression of a glycine cleavage system indicated the activation of 
      alternative metabolic pathways for acetate metabolism, which were reconstructed 
      in the most abundant bacterial genomes. Moreover, as evidenced by predicted 
      auxotrophies, we propose that specific microbes of the community were forming 
      symbiotic relationships, thus reducing the biosynthetic burden of individual 
      members. These results provide new information that will facilitate future 
      microbial ecology studies of interspecies competition and symbiosis in 
      methanogenic niches. Video abstract.

AB  - The process of nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) catalysed 
      by Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera (M. oxyfera)-like bacteria is a novel 
      pathway in regulating methane (CH(4) ) emissions from paddy fields. Nitrogen 
      fertilization is essential to improve rice yields and soil fertility; however, 
      its effect on the n-damo process is largely unknown. Here, the potential n-damo 
      activity, abundance and community composition of M. oxyfera-like bacteria were 
      investigated in paddy fields under three long-term (32 years) fertilization 
      treatments, i.e. unfertilized control (CK), chemical fertilization (NPK) and 
      straw incorporation with chemical fertilization (SNPK). Relative to the CK, both 
      NPK and SNPK treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased the potential n-damo 
      activity (88%-110%) and the abundance (52%-105%) of M. oxyfera-like bacteria. The 
      variation of soil organic carbon (OrgC) content and inorganic nitrogen content 
      caused by the input of chemical fertilizers and straw returning were identified 
      as the key factors affecting the potential n-damo activity and the abundance of 
      M. oxyfera-like bacteria. However, the community composition and diversity of M. 
      oxyfera-like bacteria did not change significantly by the input of fertilizers. 
      Overall, our results provide the first evidence that long-term fertilization 
      greatly stimulates the n-damo process, indicating its active role in controlling 
      CH(4) emissions from paddy fields.

AB  - Methanogens are a diverse group of Archaea that obligately couple energy 
      conservation to the production of methane. Some methanogens encode alternate 
      pathways for energy conservation, like anaerobic respiration, but the biochemical 
      details of this process are unknown. We show that a multiheme c-type cytochrome 
      called MmcA from Methanosarcina acetivorans is important for intracellular 
      electron transport during methanogenesis and can also reduce extracellular 
      electron acceptors like soluble Fe(3+) and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. 
      Consistent with these observations, MmcA displays reversible redox features 
      ranging from -100 to -450 mV versus SHE. Additionally, mutants lacking mmcA have 
      significantly slower Fe(3+) reduction rates. The mmcA locus is prevalent in 
      members of the Order Methanosarcinales and is a part of a distinct clade of 
      multiheme cytochromes that are closely related to octaheme tetrathionate 
      reductases. Taken together, MmcA might act as an electron conduit that can 
      potentially support a variety of energy conservation strategies that extend 
      beyond methanogenesis.

AB  - Insights into microbiota adaptation to increased ammonia stress, and 
      identification of indicator microorganisms can help to optimize the operation of 
      anaerobic digesters. To identify microbial indicators and investigate their 
      metabolic contribution to acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM), syntrophic acetate 
      oxidation (SAO) or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM), 40 anaerobic batch 
      reactors fed with acetate of 110 mmol/L were set up at NH(4)(+)-N concentrations 
      of 0.14 g/L, 5.00 g/L or 7.00 g/L, inoculated with thermophilic or mesophilic 
      microbiota with or without pre-exposure to ammonia stress. Four stable carbon 
      isotope probing approaches were applied in parallel, with [1,2-(13)C]-CH(3)COOH, 
      [2-(13)C]-CH(3)COOH, [(13)C]NaHCO(3) or non-labeled CH(3)COOH used individually. 
      The last three approaches were used to quantify the methanogenic pathways by 
      tracking labeled (13)C or natural (13)C signatures in the resulting CH(4) and 
      CO(2), and consistently detected the dynamic transition of dominant pathways from 
      AM to SAO-HM under ammonia stress. Results of quantitative PCR and fluorescence 
      in-situ hybridization illustrated the procedure, acetotrophic methanogens being 
      outcompeted by acetate-oxidizing syntrophs. The first and last isotope-labeling 
      approaches were designed to probe the active acetate-mineralizing microbes with 
      DNA-SIP. Known acetate-oxidizing bacteria like Syntrophaceticus and 
      Tepidanaerobacter, as well as novel members of Pseudomonas, Bacillus and 
      Symbiobacteraceae were detected, with Methanoculleus as the predominant 
      H(2)/CO(2)-utilizing partner. Using NanoSIMS, some bacterial cells were observed 
      to be fixing CO(2) from [(13)C]NaHCO(3). In this study, Methanosaeta was only 
      active with ammonia < 200 mg-N/L; the syntrophs catalyzing SAO-HM started to 
      compete with AM-conducting Methanosarcina at intermediate concentrations of 
      ammonia, i.e. 200-500 mg-N/L, and outcompeted the acetotrophic methanogens with 
      ammonia > 500 mg-N/L. Under ammonia stress, diverse known and novel microbial 
      taxa were involved in acetate mineralization, comparable with those identified in 
      previous studies.

LID - 10.1128/JB.00342-18 [doi]
LID - e00342-18
AB  - The methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri encodes three distinct types of 
      hydrogenase, whose functions vary depending on the growth substrate. These 
      include the F(420)-dependent (Frh), methanophenazine-dependent (Vht), and 
      ferredoxin-dependent (Ech) hydrogenases. To investigate their physiological 
      roles, we characterized a series of mutants lacking each hydrogenase in various 
      combinations. Mutants lacking Frh, Vht, or Ech in any combination failed to grow 
      on H(2)-CO(2), whereas only Vht and Ech were essential for growth on acetate. In 
      contrast, a mutant lacking all three grew on methanol with a final growth yield 
      similar to that of the wild type and produced methane and CO(2) in the expected 
      3:1 ratio but had a ca. 33% lower growth rate. Thus, hydrogenases play a 
      significant, but nonessential, role during growth on this substrate. As 
      previously observed, mutants lacking Ech failed to grow on methanol-H(2) unless 
      they were supplemented with biosynthetic precursors. Interestingly, this 
      phenotype was abolished in the Δech Δfrh and Δech Δfrh Δvht mutants, consistent 
      with the idea that hydrogenases inhibit methanol oxidation in the presence of 
      H(2), which prevents production of the reducing equivalents needed for 
      biosynthesis. Quantification of the methane and CO(2) produced from methanol by 
      resting cell suspensions of various mutants supported this conclusion. On the 
      basis of the global transcriptional profiles, none of the hydrogenases were 
      upregulated to compensate for the loss of the others. However, the transcript 
      levels of the F(420) dehydrogenase operon were significantly higher in all 
      strains lacking frh, suggesting a mechanism to sense the redox state of F(420) 
      The roles of the hydrogenases in energy conservation during growth with each 
      methanogenic pathway are discussed.IMPORTANCE Methanogenic archaea are key 
      players in the global carbon cycle due to their ability to facilitate the 
      remineralization of organic substrates in many anaerobic environments. The 
      consequences of biological methanogenesis are far-reaching, with impacts on 
      atmospheric methane and CO(2) concentrations, agriculture, energy production, 
      waste treatment, and human health. The data presented here clarify the in vivo 
      function of hydrogenases during methanogenesis, which in turn deepens our 
      understanding of this unique form of metabolism. This knowledge is critical for a 
      variety of important issues ranging from atmospheric composition to human health.

TI  - Secondary Mineralization of Ferrihydrite Affects Microbial Methanogenesis in 
      Geobacter-Methanosarcina Cocultures.

AB  - The transformation of ferrihydrite to stable iron oxides over time has important 
      consequences for biogeochemical cycling of many metals and nutrients. The 
      response of methanogenic activity to the presence of iron oxides depends on the 
      type of iron mineral, but the effects of changes in iron mineralogy on 
      methanogenesis have not been characterized. To address these issues, we 
      constructed methanogenic cocultures of Geobacter and Methanosarcina strains with 
      different ferrihydrite mineralization pathways. In this system, secondary 
      mineralization products from ferrihydrite are regulated by the presence or 
      absence of phosphate. In cultures producing magnetite as the secondary 
      mineralization product, the rates of methanogenesis from acetate and ethanol 
      increased by 30.2% and 135.3%, respectively, compared with a control lacking 
      ferrihydrite. Biogenic magnetite was proposed to promote direct interspecies 
      electron transfer between Geobacter and Methanosarcina in a manner similar to 
      that of c-type cytochrome and thus facilitate methanogenesis. Vivianite 
      biomineralization from ferrihydrite in the presence of phosphate did not 
      significantly influence the methanogenesis processes. The correlation between 
      magnetite occurrence and facilitated methanogenesis was supported by increased 
      rates of methane production from acetate and ethanol with magnetite 
      supplementation in the defined cocultures. Our data provide a new perspective on 
      the important role of iron biomineralization in biogeochemical cycling of carbon 
      in diverse anaerobic environments. IMPORTANCE: It has been found that microbial 
      methanogenesis is affected by the presence of iron minerals, and their influences 
      on methanogenesis are associated with the mineralogical properties of the iron 
      minerals. However, how changes in iron mineralogy affect microbial methanogenesis 
      has not been characterized. To address this issue, we constructed methanogenic 
      cocultures of Geobacter and Methanosarcina strains with different ferrihydrite 
      mineralization pathways. The experimental results led to two contributions, i.e., 
      (i) the transformation of iron minerals might exert an important influence on 
      methanogenesis under anaerobic conditions and (ii) both biogenic and chemical 
      magnetite can accelerate syntrophic ethanol oxidization between Geobacter 
      metallireducens and Methanosarcina barkeri This study sheds new light on the 
      important role of iron biomineralization in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon 
      in diverse anaerobic environments, particularly in iron-rich natural and 
      agricultural wetland soils.

AB  - Communities of methanogens, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and aerobic 
      methanotrophic bacteria (MOB) were compared by profiling polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR)-amplified products of mcrA and pmoA genes encoded by 
      methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit and particulate methane monooxygenase 
      alpha subunit, respectively, in sediments of northern South China Sea (nSCS) and 
      Mai Po mangrove wetland. Community structures representing by mcrA gene based on 
      12 clone libraries from nSCS showed separate clusters indicating niche 
      specificity, while, Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales clades 1,2, and 
      Methanomassiliicoccus-like groups of methanogens were the most abundant groups in 
      nSCS sediment samples. Novel clusters specific to the SCS were identified and the 
      phylogeny of mcrA gene-harboring archaea was updated. Quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction was used to detect mcrA gene abundance in all samples: similar 
      abundance of mcrA gene in the surface layers of mangrove (3.4∼3.9 × 10(6) copies 
      per gram dry weight) and of intertidal mudflat (5.5∼5.8 × 10(6) copies per gram 
      dry weight) was observed, but higher abundance (6.9 × 10(6) to 1.02 × 10(8) 
      copies per gram dry weight) was found in subsurface samples of both sediment 
      types. Aerobic MOB were more abundant in surface layers (6.7∼11.1 × 10(5) copies 
      per gram dry weight) than the subsurface layers (1.2∼5.9 × 10(5) copies per gram 
      dry weight) based on pmoA gene. Mangrove surface layers harbored more abundant 
      pmoA gene than intertidal mudflat, but less pmoA genes in the subsurface layers. 
      Meanwhile, it is also noted that in surface layers of all samples, more pmoA gene 
      copies were detected than the subsurface layers. Reedbed rhizosphere exhibited 
      the highest gene abundance of mcrA gene (8.51 × 10(8) copies per gram dry weight) 
      and pmoA gene (1.56 × 10(7) copies per gram dry weight). This study investigated 
      the prokaryotic communities responsible for methane cycling in both marine and 
      coastal wetland ecosystems, showing the distribution characteristics of mcrA 
      gene-harboring communities in nSCS and stratification of mcrA and pmoA gene 
      diversity and abundance in the Mai Po Nature Reserve.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is achieved through cooperation among various types of 
      microorganisms, and the regulation of microbial communities is key to achieving 
      stable system operation. In this study, the r/K selection theory was adopted to 
      examine the system performance and microbial characteristics in anaerobic 
      reactors with different operating modes (continuous-flow reactors, CFRs; 
      sequencing batch reactors, SBRs) and sludge retention times (25 and 10 days). 
      Four lab-scale reactors (CFR(25d), CFR(10d), SBR(25d), and SBR(10d)) were 
      operated. In the cycle reaction, CFR(25d) achieved the highest methane yield 
      (678.0 mL/L) and methane production rate (140.8 mL/(L·h)); while those in 
      CFR(10d) were the lowest, which could have been due to an accumulation of 
      volatile fatty acids. CFR could wash out r-strategists efficiently, such as 
      Methanosarcina. CFR(25d) and CFR(10d) significantly enriched the K-strategist 
      Geobacter, with the relative abundances of 34.0% and 72.6%, respectively. In 
      addition, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens of Methanolinea and Methanospirillum 
      (K-strategists) dominated in CFR(25d) and CFR(10d). Methanobacterium adapted to 
      the diverse operational conditions, but the slow grower Methanosaeta only 
      accounted for 0.9% in CFR(10d). Failure to enrich propionate oxidizers resulted 
      in a functional absence of propionate degradation in the CFRs.

AB  - Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion usually contains 30%-50% CO(2,) much of 
      which must be removed, before utilization. Bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading 
      approaches show promise, however, they have not yet been optimized for practical 
      applications. In this study, a bioelectrochemical system with low energy input 
      (applied cathode potential of -0.5 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) was 
      used for in-situ biogas upgrading. High efficiency CO(2) conversion 
      (318.5 mol/d/m(2)) was achieved when the system was operated with an organic load 
      of 1.7 kgCOD/(m(3) d). Methane content in the upgraded biogas was 97.0% and CO(2) 
      concentrations stayed below 3%, which is comparable to biogas upgraded with more 
      expensive and less sustainable physiochemical approaches. The high efficiency of 
      this approach could likely be attributed to a significant enrichment of 
      Methanothrix (92.7%) species on the cathode surface that were expressing genes 
      involved in both acetogenic methanogenesis and direct electron transfer (DET). 
      Electromethanogenesis by these organisms also increased proton consumption and 
      created a higher pH that increased the solubility of CO(2) in the bioreactor. In 
      addition, CO(2) removal from the biogas was likely further enhanced by an 
      enrichment of Actinobacillus species known to be capable of CO(2) fixation. 
      Artificial neural network (ANN) models were also used to estimate CH(4) 
      production under different loading conditions. The ANN architecture with 10 
      neurons at hidden layers fit best with a mean square error of 6.06 × 10(-3) and 
      R(2) of 0.99.

AB  - Lindane, the γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomer, was among the most used 
      pesticides worldwide. Although it was banned in 2009, residues of Lindane and 
      other HCH-isomers are still found with high concentrations in contaminated 
      fields. For clean-up, phytoremediation combined with anaerobic digestion (AD) of 
      contaminated biomass to produce biogas and fertilizer could be a promising 
      strategy and was tested in two 15 L laboratory-scale continuous stirred tank 
      reactors. During operation over one year by adding HCH isomers (γ, α and β) 
      consecutively, no negative influence on conventional reactor parameters was 
      observed. The γ- and α-HCH isomers were transformed to chlorobenzene and benzene, 
      and transformation became faster along with time, while β-HCH was not removed. 
      Genus Methanosaeta and order Clostridiales, showing significant enhancement on 
      abundance with HCH addition, may be used as bioindicators for HCH dehalogenation 
      in AD process. The potential for HCH degradation in AD system was restricted to 
      axial Cl atoms of HCH and it showed slight enantioselective preference towards 
      transformation of (+) α-HCH. Moreover, metabolite benzene was mineralized to 
      CO(2) and methane, deducing from tracer experiments with benzene-(13)C(6). 
      Overall, AD appears to be a feasible option for treatment of γ and α-HCHs 
      contaminated biomass.

TI  - Assessment of the oxidant tolerance of Methanosarcina acetivorans.
PG  - 13-9
LID - 10.1111/1574-6968.12115 [doi]
AB  - All methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) are strict anaerobes, but the 
      majority of species are tolerant to oxidants. Methanosarcina species are 
      important environmental and industrial methanogens as they are one of only two 
      genera capable of producing methane with acetate. Importantly, Methanosarcina 
      species appear to be the most oxidant-tolerant; however, the mechanisms 
      underlying this tolerance are poorly understood. We report herein two similar 
      methods (spot-plating and microtiter plate) developed to examine the oxidant 
      tolerance of Methanosarcina acetivorans by viability assessment. Both methods 
      revealed that M. acetivorans can tolerate exposure to millimolar levels of 
      hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ) without a complete loss of viability. The exogenous 
      addition of catalase was also shown to protect M. acetivorans from H2O2 toxicity, 
      indicating catalase can serve as an antioxidant enzyme in methanogens even though 
      oxygen is a byproduct. Of the two methods, the microtiter plate method provided a 
      simple, reliable, and inexpensive method to assess viability of M. acetivorans. 
      Combined with recent advances in the genetic manipulation of methanogens, methods 
      in assessment of methanogen oxidant tolerance will aid in the identification of 
      components of the antioxidant defense systems.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of microbial consortium from natural crude oil that seeps 
      into the marine ecosystem offshore Southern California.
PG  - 1259-74
LID - 10.4056/sigs.5029016 [doi]
AB  - Crude oils can be major contaminants of the marine ecosystem and microorganisms 
      play a significant role in the degradation of its main constituents. To increase 
      our understanding of the microbial hydrocarbon degradation process in the marine 
      ecosystem, we collected crude oil from an active seep area located in the Santa 
      Barbara Channel (SBC) and generated a total of about 52 Gb of raw metagenomic 
      sequence data. The assembled data comprised ~500 Mb, representing ~1.1 million 
      genes derived primarily from chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. Members of 
      Oceanospirillales, a bacterial order belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria, 
      recruited less than 2% of the assembled genes within the SBC metagenome. In 
      contrast, the microbial community associated with the oil plume that developed in 
      the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout in 2010, was dominated by 
      Oceanospirillales, which comprised more than 60% of the metagenomic data 
      generated from the DWH oil plume. This suggests that Oceanospirillales might play 
      a less significant role in the microbially mediated hydrocarbon conversion within 
      the SBC seep oil compared to the DWH plume oil. We hypothesize that this 
      difference results from the SBC oil seep being mostly anaerobic, while the DWH 
      oil plume is aerobic. Within the Archaea, the phylum Euryarchaeota, recruited 
      more than 95% of the assembled archaeal sequences from the SBC oil seep 
      metagenome, with more than 50% of the sequences assigned to members of the orders 
      Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales. These orders contain organisms capable 
      of anaerobic methanogenesis and methane oxidation (AOM) and we hypothesize that 
      these orders - and their metabolic capabilities - may be fundamental to the 
      ecology of the SBC oil seep.

      during methanation of syngas (56% H(2), 30% CO, 14% CO(2)) was investigated using 
      three different nutrient media: defined nutrient medium (241 days), diluted 
      digestate from a thermophilic co-digestion plant operating with food waste 
      (200 days) and reject water from dewatered digested sewage sludge at a wastewater 
      treatment plant (220 days). Different TBR operating periods showed slightly 
      different performance that was not clearly linked to the nutrient medium, as all 
      proved suitable for the methanation process. During operation, maximum syngas 
      load was 5.33 L per L packed bed volume (pbv) & day and methane (CH(4)) 
      production was 1.26 L CH(4)/L(pbv)/d. Microbial community analysis with Illumina 
      Miseq targeting 16S rDNA revealed high relative abundance (20-40%) of several 
      potential syngas and acetate consumers within the genera Sporomusa, 
      Spirochaetaceae, Rikenellaceae and Acetobacterium during the process. These were 
      the dominant taxa except in a period with high flow rate of digestate from the 
      food waste plant. The dominant methanogen in all periods was a member of the 
      genus Methanobacterium, while Methanosarcina was also observed in the carrier 
      community. As in reactor effluent, the dominant bacterial genus in the carrier 
      was Sporomusa. These results show that syngas methanation in TBR can proceed well 
      with different nutrient sources, including undefined medium of different origins. 
      Moreover, the dominant syngas community remained the same over time even when 
      non-sterilised digestates were used as nutrient medium. KEY POINTS: • Independent 
      of nutrient source, syngas methanation above 1 L/L(pbv)/D was achieved. • 
      Methanobacterium and Sporomusa were dominant genera throughout the process. • 
      Acetate conversion proceeded via both methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate 
      oxidation.

AB  - Bacterial and archaeal communities in sediments obtained from three 
      geographically-distant mud volcanoes, a control site and a microbial mat in the 
      Eastern Mediterranean deep-sea were characterized using direct 16S rRNA gene 
      analyses. The data were thus in relation to the chemical characteristics of the 
      (stratified) habitats to infer community structure-habitat relationships. The 
      bacterial sequences in the different habitats were related to those of 
      Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Chloroflexi, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta- and 
      Epsilonproteobacteria and unclassified bacteria, including the JS1 group. The 
      archaeal sequences found were affiliated with those of the Methanosarcinales, 
      Thermoplasmales, Halobacteriales and Crenarchaea belonging to marine benthic 
      group I and B, as well as MCG group archaea. In each sample, the communities were 
      diverse and unique at the phylotype level. However, at higher taxonomic levels, 
      similar groups were found in different sediments, and similar depth layers tended 
      to contain similar communities. The sequences that dominated in all top layers 
      (as well as in the mat) probably represented organisms involved in aerobic 
      heterotrophy, sulfide-based chemoautotrophy and methanotrophy and/or 
      methylotrophy. Sequences of organisms most likely involved in anaerobic methane 
      oxidation, sulfate reduction and anaerobic heterotrophy were predominantly found 
      in deeper layers. The data supported the notion of (1) uniqueness of each habitat 
      at fine taxonomic levels, (2) stratification in depth and (3) conservation of 
      function in the sediments.

TI  - Increases in temperature and nutrient availability positively affect 
      methane-cycling microorganisms in Arctic thermokarst lake sediments.

AB  - Arctic permafrost soils store large amounts of organic matter that is sensitive 
      to temperature increases and subsequent microbial degradation to methane (CH (4) 
      ) and carbon dioxide (CO (2) ). Here, we studied methanogenic and methanotrophic 
      activity and community composition in thermokarst lake sediments from Utqiag˙vik 
      (formerly Barrow), Alaska. This experiment was carried out under in situ 
      temperature conditions (4°C) and the IPCC 2013 Arctic climate change scenario 
      (10°C) after addition of methanogenic and methanotrophic substrates for nearly a 
      year. Trimethylamine (TMA) amendment with warming showed highest maximum CH (4) 
      production rates, being 30% higher at 10°C than at 4°C. Maximum methanotrophic 
      rates increased by up to 57% at 10°C compared to 4°C. 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
      indicated high relative abundance of Methanosarcinaceae in TMA amended 
      incubations, and for methanotrophic incubations Methylococcaeae were highly 
      enriched. Anaerobic methanotrophic activity with nitrite or nitrate as electron 
      acceptor was not detected. This study indicates that the methane cycling 
      microbial community can adapt to temperature increases and that their activity is 
      highly dependent on substrate availability.

TI  - Identification of novel potential acetate-oxidizing bacteria in thermophilic 
      methanogenic chemostats by DNA stable isotope probing.
PG  - 8631-8645

AB  - Syntrophic oxidization of acetate and propionate are both critical steps of 
      methanogenesis during thermophilic anaerobic digestion. However, knowledge on 
      syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) and syntrophic propionate-oxidizing 
      bacteria (SPOB) is limited because of the difficulty in pure culture isolation 
      due to symbiotic relationship. In this study, two thermophilic acetate-fed 
      anaerobic chemostats, ATL (dilution rate of 0.025 day(-1)) and ATH (0.05 day(-1)) 
      and one thermophilic propionate-fed anaerobic chemostat PTL (0.025 day(-1)) were 
      constructed, AOB and POB in these chemostats were studied via microbial community 
      analysis and DNA stable-isotope probing (SIP). The results showed that, in 
      addition to Tepidanaerobacter, a known SAOB, species of Thauera, 
      Thermodesulfovibrio, Anaerobaculum, Ruminiclostridium, Comamonas, and uncultured 
      bacteria belonging to Lentimicrobiaceae, o_MBA03, Thermoanaerobacteraceae, 
      Anaerolineaceae, Clostridiales, and Ruminococcaceae were determined to be 
      potential AOB in chemostats. Pelotomaculum was the key SPOB detected in the 
      propionate-fed chemostat. Based on the intense fluorescence of coenzyme F(420), 
      majority of Methanosarcina cells in acetate-fed chemostats were involved in 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, suggesting the existence of highly active SAOB 
      among the detected AOB. In the propionate-fed chemostat, most of the species 
      detected as AOB were similar to those detected in the acetate-fed chemostats, 
      suggesting the contribution of the syntrophic acetate oxidization pathway for 
      methane generation. These results revealed the existence of previously unknown 
      AOB with high diversity in thermophilic chemostats and suggested that 
      methanogenesis from acetate via the syntrophic oxidization pathway is relevant 
      for thermophilic anaerobic digestion.

TI  - Accelerated methanogenesis from aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons under iron- 
      and sulfate-reducing conditions.
PG  - 6-16

AB  - The impact of four electron acceptors on hydrocarbon-induced methanogenesis was 
      studied. Methanogenesis from residual hydrocarbons may enhance the exploitation 
      of oil reservoirs and may improve bioremediation. The conditions to drive the 
      rate-limiting first hydrocarbon-oxidizing steps for the conversion of 
      hydrocarbons into methanogenic substrates are crucial. Thus, the electron 
      acceptors ferrihydrite, manganese dioxide, nitrate or sulfate were added to 
      sediment microcosms acquired from two brackish water locations. Hexadecane, 
      ethylbenzene or 1-(13)C-naphthalene were used as model hydrocarbons. Methane was 
      released most rapidly from incubations amended with ferrihydrite and hexadecane. 
      Ferrihydrite enhanced only hexadecane-dependent methanogenesis. The rates of 
      methanogenesis were negatively affected by sulfate and nitrate at concentrations 
      of more than 5 and 1 mM, respectively. Metal-reducing Geobacteraceae and 
      potential sulfate reducers as well as Methanosarcina were present in situ and in 
      vitro. Ferrihydrite addition triggered the growth of Methanosarcina-related 
      methanogens. Additionally, methane was removed concomitantly by anaerobic 
      methanotrophy. ANME-1 and -2 methyl coenzyme M reductase genes were detected, 
      indicating anaerobic methanotrophy as an accompanying process [Correction added 
      16 December after online publication: 'methyl coenzyme A' changed to 'methyl 
      coenzyme M' in this sentence]. The experiments presented here demonstrate the 
      feasibility of enhancing methanogenic alkane degradation by ferrihydrite or 
      sulfate addition in different geological settings.

AB  - Wheat straw (WS) was pretreated with four concentrations of H2O2 (1%, 2%, 3%, and 
      4%) and was anaerobically codigested with dairy cattle manure (CM) at various 
      ratios from 100:0 to 0:100. Wet-state H2O2 pretreatment effectively enhanced the 
      biodegradability and methane yield of the WS. The optimal concentration of H2O2 
      for treating WS was 3%. The methane yield was higher with the codigestion of CM 
      and H2O2-treated WS than with untreated WS and higher than with H2O2-treated WS 
      alone or CM alone. A 40:60 ratio of H2O2-treated WS mixed with CM produced the 
      highest yield of methane (320.8 mL g volatile solid (VS)(-1)). Results of 
      high-throughput sequencing indicated that the methanogenic community shifted 
      during the codigestion from the acetoclastic methanogens, Methanosarcina, to the 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanosphaera and Methanoculleus.

TI  - Potential for Methanosarcina to Contribute to Uranium Reduction during 
      Acetate-Promoted Groundwater Bioremediation.
PG  - 660-667

AB  - Previous studies of acetate-promoted bioremediation of uranium-contaminated 
      aquifers focused on Geobacter because no other microorganisms that can couple the 
      oxidation of acetate with U(VI) reduction had been detected in situ. Monitoring 
      the levels of methyl CoM reductase subunit A (mcrA) transcripts during an 
      acetate-injection field experiment demonstrated that acetoclastic methanogens 
      from the genus Methanosarcina were enriched after 40 days of acetate amendment. 
      The increased abundance of Methanosarcina corresponded with an accumulation of 
      methane in the groundwater. In order to determine whether Methanosarcina species 
      could be participating in U(VI) reduction in the subsurface, cell suspensions of 
      Methanosarcina barkeri were incubated in the presence of U(VI) with acetate 
      provided as the electron donor. U(VI) was reduced by metabolically active M. 
      barkeri cells; however, no U(VI) reduction was observed in inactive controls. 
      These results demonstrate that Methanosarcina species could play an important 
      role in the long-term bioremediation of uranium-contaminated aquifers after 
      depletion of Fe(III) oxides limits the growth of Geobacter species. The results 
      also suggest that Methanosarcina have the potential to influence uranium 
      geochemistry in a diversity of anaerobic sedimentary environments.

TI  - The archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans contains a protein disulfide reductase 
      with an iron-sulfur cluster.
PG  - 7475-84
AB  - Methanosarcina acetivorans, a strictly anaerobic methane-producing species 
      belonging to the domain Archaea, contains a gene cluster annotated with homologs 
      encoding oxidative stress proteins. One of the genes (MA3736) is annotated as a 
      gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, an enzyme 
      required for aerobic growth with aromatic compounds by species in the domain 
      Bacteria. Methane-producing species are not known to utilize aromatic compounds, 
      suggesting that MA3736 is incorrectly annotated. The product of MA3736, 
      overproduced in Escherichia coli, had protein disulfide reductase activity 
      dependent on a C(67)XXC(70) motif not found in carboxymuconolactone 
      decarboxylase. We propose that MA3736 be renamed mdrA (methanosarcina disulfide 
      reductase). Further, unlike carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, MdrA contained an 
      Fe-S cluster. Binding of the Fe-S cluster was dependent on essential cysteines 
      C(67) and C(70), while cysteines C(39) and C(107) were not required. Loss of the 
      Fe-S cluster resulted in conversion of MdrA from an inactive hexamer to a trimer 
      with protein disulfide reductase activity. The data suggest that MdrA is the 
      prototype of a previously unrecognized protein disulfide reductase family which 
      contains an intermolecular Fe-S cluster that controls oligomerization as a 
      mechanism to regulate protein disulfide reductase activity.

TI  - Methyl-coenzyme M reductase genes: unique functional markers for methanogenic and 
      anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea.
PG  - 428-42
AB  - In many anoxic environments, methanogenesis is the predominant terminal electron 
      accepting process involved in the mineralization of organic matter, which is 
      catalyzed by methanogenic Archaea. These organisms represent a unique but 
      phylogenetically diverse guild of prokaryotes, which can be conveniently tracked 
      in the environment by targeting the mcrA gene as a functional marker. This gene 
      encodes the alpha subunit of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), which 
      catalyzes the last step in methanogenesis and is present in all methanogens. 
      Cultivation-independent analysis of methanogenic communities involves the 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the mcrA gene from extracted 
      community DNA, comparative analysis of mcrA clone libraries, or PCR-based 
      fingerprinting analysis by terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis 
      (T-RFLP). It has also been suggested that anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea 
      possess MCR, which facilitates detection of this novel group of "reverse 
      methanogens" as well using the mcrA gene as a functional marker.

AB  - Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) between exoelectrogenic bacteria and 
      methanogenic archaea via conductive materials is reported as an efficient method 
      to produce methane in anaerobic organic waste digestion. A voltage can be applied 
      to the conductive materials to accelerate the DIET between two groups of 
      microorganisms to produce methane. To evaluate this hypothesis, two sets of 
      anaerobic serum bottles with and without applied voltage were used with a pair of 
      graphite rods as conductive materials to facilitate DIET. Initially, the methane 
      production rate was similar between the two sets of serum bottles, and later the 
      serum bottles with an applied voltage of 0.39V showed a 168% higher methane 
      production rate than serum bottles without an applied voltage. In cyclic 
      voltammograms, the characteristic redox peaks for hydrogen and acetate oxidation 
      were identified in the serum bottles with an applied voltage. In the microbial 
      community analyses, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g. Methanobacterium) were 
      observed to be abundant in serum bottles with an applied voltage, while 
      methanogens utilizing carbon dioxide (e.g., Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina) were 
      dominant in serum bottles without an applied voltage. Taken together, the applied 
      voltage on conductive materials might not be effective to promote DIET in methane 
      production. Instead, it appeared to generate a condition for hydrogenotrophic 
      methanogenesis.

TI  - Early response of methanogenic archaea to H(2) as evaluated by metagenomics and 
      metatranscriptomics.
PG  - 127

LID - 127
AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular machinery of the complex microbiological cell factory 
      of biomethane production is not fully understood. One of the process control 
      elements is the regulatory role of hydrogen (H(2)). Reduction of carbon dioxide 
      (CO(2)) by H(2) is rate limiting factor in methanogenesis, but the community 
      intends to keep H(2) concentration low in order to maintain the redox balance of 
      the overall system. H(2) metabolism in methanogens becomes increasingly important 
      in the Power-to-Gas renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. 
      RESULTS: The early response of the mixed mesophilic microbial community to H(2) 
      gas injection was investigated with the goal of uncovering the first responses of 
      the microbial community in the CH(4) formation and CO(2) mitigation Power-to-Gas 
      process. The overall microbial composition changes, following a 10 min excessive 
      bubbling of H(2) through the reactor, was investigated via metagenome and 
      metatranscriptome sequencing. The overall composition and taxonomic abundance of 
      the biogas producing anaerobic community did not change appreciably 2 hours after 
      the H(2) treatment, indicating that this time period was too short to display 
      differences in the proliferation of the members of the microbial community. There 
      was, however, a substantial increase in the expression of genes related to 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of certain groups of Archaea. As an early 
      response to H(2) exposure the activity of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in 
      the genus Methanoculleus was upregulated but the hydrogenotrophic pathway in 
      genus Methanosarcina was downregulated. The RT-qPCR data corroborated the 
      metatranscriptomic RESULTS: H(2) injection also altered the metabolism of a 
      number of microbes belonging in the kingdom Bacteria. Many Bacteria possess the 
      enzyme sets for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. These and the homoacetogens are 
      partners for syntrophic community interactions between the distinct kingdoms of 
      Archaea and Bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: External H(2) regulates the functional 
      activity of certain Bacteria and Archaea. The syntrophic cross-kingdom 
      interactions in H(2) metabolism are important for the efficient operation of the 
      Power-to-Gas process. Therefore, mixed communities are recommended for the large 
      scale Power-to-Gas process rather than single hydrogenotrophic methanogen 
      strains. Fast and reproducible response from the microbial community can be 
      exploited in turn-off and turn-on of the Power-to-Gas microbial cell factories.

AB  - Methanogenic archaea play a key role in the global carbon cycle because these 
      microorganisms remineralize organic compounds in various anaerobic environments. 
      The microorganism Methanosarcina barkeri is a metabolically versatile methanogen, 
      which can utilize acetate, methanol, and H(2)/CO(2) to synthesize methane. 
      However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying methanogenesis for different 
      substrates remain unknown. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was used to 
      investigate M. barkeri growth and gene transcription under different substrate 
      regimes. According to the results, M. barkeri showed the best growth under 
      methanol, followed by H(2)/CO(2) and acetate, and these findings corresponded 
      well with the observed variations in genes transcription abundance for different 
      substrates. In addition, we identified a novel regulator, MSBRM_RS03855 
      (designated as HdrR), which specifically activates the transcription of the 
      heterodisulfide reductase hdrBCA operon in M. barkeri. HdrR was able to bind to 
      the hdrBCA operon promoter to regulate transcription. Furthermore, the structural 
      model analyses revealed a helix-turn-helix domain, which is likely involved in 
      DNA binding. Taken together, HdrR serves as a model to reveal how certain 
      regulatory factors control the expression of key enzymes in the methanogenic 
      pathway.IMPORTANCEThe microorganism Methanosarcina barkeri has a pivotal role in 
      the global carbon cycle and contributes to global temperature homeostasis. The 
      consequences of biological methanogenesis are far-reaching, including impacts on 
      atmospheric methane and CO(2) concentrations, agriculture, energy production, 
      waste treatment, and human health. As such, reducing methane emissions is crucial 
      to meeting set climate goals. The methanogenic activity of certain microorganisms 
      can be drastically reduced by inhibiting the transcription of the hdrBCA operon, 
      which encodes heterodisulfide reductases. Here, we provide novel insight into the 
      mechanisms regulating hdrBCA operon transcription in the model methanogen M. 
      barkeri. The results clarified that HdrR serves as a regulator of heterodisulfide 
      reductase hdrBCA operon transcription during methanogenesis, which expands our 
      understanding of the unique regulatory mechanisms that govern methanogenesis. The 
      findings presented in this study can further our understanding of how genetic 
      regulation can effectively reduce the methane emissions caused by methanogens.

TI  - Acetate oxidation is the dominant methanogenic pathway from acetate in the 
      absence of Methanosaetaceae.
PG  - 5138-41
AB  - The oxidation of acetate to hydrogen, and the subsequent conversion of hydrogen 
      and carbon dioxide to methane, has been regarded largely as a niche mechanism 
      occurring at high temperatures or under inhibitory conditions. In this study, 13 
      anaerobic reactors and sediment from a temperate anaerobic lake were surveyed for 
      their dominant methanogenic population by using fluorescent in situ hybridization 
      and for the degree of acetate oxidation relative to aceticlastic conversion by 
      using radiolabeled [2-14C]acetate in batch incubations. When Methanosaetaceae 
      were not present, acetate oxidation was the dominant methanogenic pathway. 
      Aceticlastic conversion was observed only in the presence of Methanosaetaceae.

AB  - Few studies have specifically dealt so far with methanogen-related archaea in 
      estuarine sediments. In this study, methanogen-related archaeal populations were 
      investigated by 16S rRNA gene clone library, T-RFLP analysis, and methanogen 
      enrichment in Pearl River estuarine sediments. The majority of obtained sequences 
      in clone libraries and T-RF peaks from T-RFLP analysis were assigned mainly to 
      Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales/ANME. The fragments of 
      Methanosarcinales/ANME were most dominant group (mean 47%) and composed largely 
      of ANME-2a which are characterized as anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea in 
      broad environments. Furthermore Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobiales accounted for 
      23 and 29% of fragments, respectively, for all depths. Therefore, the presence of 
      Methanomicrobiales and Methanosaeta in Pearl River estuarine sediments was 
      indicative of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. In addition, 
      the enrichments of methanogens also suggested the presence of acetoclastic and 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens in Pearl River estuarine sediments. This study is a 
      significant step toward understanding methane cycling association of 
      representative archaea in estuarine environments.

      anaerobic processes.
PG  - 303-8
LID - 10.2166/wst.2012.856 [doi]
AB  - Wastes from the personal care product (PCP) industry are often high in 
      biodegradable carbon, which makes them amenable to aerobic biological treatment, 
      although process costs are usually high due to aeration inefficiencies, high 
      electricity demand and production of large amounts of sludge. As such, anaerobic 
      treatment technologies are being considered to lower net energy costs by reducing 
      air use and increasing methane production. To assess the amenability of PCP 
      wastes to anaerobic treatment, methane yields and rates were quantified in 
      different anaerobic reactors treating typical PCP wastes, including wastes from 
      shampoo and hair colorant products. Overall, shampoo wastes were more amenable to 
      methanogenesis with almost double the methane yields compared with colour wastes. 
      To assess relevant microbial guilds, qPCR was performed on reactor biomass 
      samples. Methanosaetaceae abundances were always significantly higher than 
      Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomicrobiales abundances (P < 0.05), and did not 
      differ significantly between waste types. Although colour wastes were less 
      amenable to anaerobic treatment than shampoo wastes, differences cannot be 
      explained by relative microbial abundances and probably result from the presence 
      of inhibiting compounds in hair colorants (e.g., oxidants) at higher levels. 
      Results showed that anaerobic technologies have great potential for treating PCP 
      wastes, but additional work is needed to establish the basis of elevated methane 
      yields and inhibition, especially when colorant wastes are present.

      not well understood. Here, we construct model synthetic communities using a 
      sulfate reducer and two types of methanogens representing different 
      methanogenesis routes. We find that tri-cultures with both routes increase 
      methane production by almost twofold compared to co-cultures and are stable in 
      the absence of sulfate. With increasing sulfate, system stability and 
      productivity decreases and does so faster in communities with 
      aceto/hydrogenotrophic methanogens despite the continued presence of acetate. We 
      show that this is due to a shift in the metabolism of these methanogens towards 
      co-utilization of hydrogen with acetate. These findings indicate the important 
      role of hydrogen dynamics in the stability and productivity of syntrophic 
      communities.

TI  - Hydrogen production by methanogens under low-hydrogen conditions.
PG  - 415-21
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in four species of methanogens 
      (Methanothermobacter marburgensis, Methanosaeta thermophila, Methanosarcina 
      barkeri, and Methanosaeta concilii) under conditions of low (sub-nanomolar) 
      ambient hydrogen concentration using a specially designed culture apparatus. 
      Transient hydrogen production was observed and quantified for each species 
      studied. Methane was excluded as the electron source, as was all organic material 
      added during growth of the cultures (acetate, yeast extract, peptone). Hydrogen 
      production showed a strong temperature dependence, and production ceased at 
      temperatures below the growth range of the organisms. Addition of polysulfides to 
      the cultures greatly decreased hydrogen production. The addition of 
      bromoethanesulfonic acid had little influence on hydrogen production. These 
      experiments demonstrate that some methanogens produce excess reducing equivalents 
      during growth and convert them to hydrogen when the ambient hydrogen 
      concentration becomes low. The lack of sustained hydrogen production by the 
      cultures in the presence of methane provides evidence against "reverse 
      methanogenesis" as the mechanism for anaerobic methane oxidation.

TI  - Methane- and sulfur-metabolizing microbial communities dominate the Lost City 
      hydrothermal field ecosystem.
PG  - 6257-70
AB  - Hydrothermal venting and the formation of carbonate chimneys in the Lost City 
      hydrothermal field (LCHF) are driven predominantly by serpentinization reactions 
      and cooling of mantle rocks, resulting in a highly reducing, high-pH environment 
      with abundant dissolved hydrogen and methane. Phylogenetic and terminal 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of 16S rRNA genes in fluids and 
      carbonate material from this site indicate the presence of organisms similar to 
      sulfur-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing, and methane-oxidizing Bacteria as well as 
      methanogenic and anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea. The presence of these 
      metabolic groups indicates that microbial cycling of sulfur and methane may be 
      the dominant biogeochemical processes active within this ultramafic rock-hosted 
      environment. 16S rRNA gene sequences grouping within the Methylobacter and 
      Thiomicrospira clades were recovered from a chemically diverse suite of carbonate 
      chimney and fluid samples. In contrast, 16S rRNA genes corresponding to the Lost 
      City Methanosarcinales phylotype were found exclusively in high-temperature 
      chimneys, while a phylotype of anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea (ANME-1) was 
      restricted to lower-temperature, less vigorously venting sites. A 
      hyperthermophilic habitat beneath the LCHF may be reflected by 16S rRNA gene 
      sequences belonging to Thermococcales and uncultured Crenarchaeota identified in 
      vent fluids. The finding of a diverse microbial ecosystem supported by the 
      interaction of high-temperature, high-pH fluids resulting from serpentinization 
      reactions in the subsurface provides insight into the biogeochemistry of what may 
      be a pervasive process in ultramafic subseafloor environments.

AB  - Syntrophic interaction occurs during anaerobic fermentation of organic substances 
      forming methane as the final product. H2 and formate are known to serve as the 
      electron carriers in this process. Recently, it has been shown that direct 
      interspecies electron transfer (DIET) occurs for syntrophic CH4 production from 
      ethanol and acetate. Here, we constructed paddy soil enrichments to determine the 
      involvement of DIET in syntrophic butyrate oxidation and CH4 production. The 
      results showed that CH4 production was significantly accelerated in the presence 
      of nanoFe3 O4 in all continuous transfers. This acceleration increased with the 
      increase of nanoFe3 O4 concentration but was dismissed when Fe3 O4 was coated 
      with silica that insulated the mineral from electrical conduction. NanoFe3 O4 
      particles were found closely attached to the cell surfaces of different 
      morphology, thus bridging cell connections. Molecular approaches, including 
      DNA-based stable isotope probing, revealed that the bacterial Syntrophomonadaceae 
      and Geobacteraceae, and the archaeal Methanosarcinaceae, Methanocellales and 
      Methanobacteriales, were involved in the syntrophic butyrate oxidation and CH4 
      production. Among them, the growth of Geobacteraceae strictly relied on the 
      presence of nanoFe3 O4 and its electrical conductivity in particular. Other 
      organisms, except Methanobacteriales, were present in enrichments regardless of 
      nanoFe3 O4 amendment. Collectively, our study demonstrated that the nanoFe3 O4 
      -facilitated DIET occurred in syntrophic CH4 production from butyrate, and 
      Geobacter species played the key role in this process in the paddy soil 
      enrichments.

TI  - Proteotyping of biogas plant microbiomes separates biogas plants according to 
      process temperature and reactor type.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methane yield and biogas productivity of biogas plants (BGPs) depend 
      on microbial community structure and function, substrate supply, and general 
      biogas process parameters. So far, however, relatively little is known about 
      correlations between microbial community function and process parameters. To 
      close this knowledge gap, microbial communities of 40 samples from 35 different 
      industrial biogas plants were evaluated by a metaproteomics approach in this 
      study. RESULTS: Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
      (Orbitrap Elite™ Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer) of all 40 samples as 
      triplicate enabled the identification of 3138 different metaproteins belonging to 
      162 biological processes and 75 different taxonomic orders. The respective 
      database searches were performed against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and seven 
      metagenome databases. Subsequent clustering and principal component analysis of 
      these data allowed for the identification of four main clusters associated with 
      mesophile and thermophile process conditions, the use of upflow anaerobic sludge 
      blanket reactors and BGP feeding with sewage sludge. Observations confirm a 
      previous phylogenetic study of the same BGP samples that was based on 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing by De Vrieze et al. (Water Res 75:312-323, 2015). In particular, 
      we identified similar microbial key players of biogas processes, namely 
      Bacillales, Enterobacteriales, Bacteriodales, Clostridiales, Rhizobiales and 
      Thermoanaerobacteriales as well as Methanobacteriales, Methanosarcinales and 
      Methanococcales. For the elucidation of the main biomass degradation pathways, 
      the most abundant 1 % of metaproteins was assigned to the KEGG map 1200 
      representing the central carbon metabolism. Additionally, the effect of the 
      process parameters (i) temperature, (ii) organic loading rate (OLR), (iii) total 
      ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and (iv) sludge retention time (SRT) on these pathways 
      was investigated. For example, high TAN correlated with hydrogenotrophic 
      methanogens and bacterial one-carbon metabolism, indicating syntrophic acetate 
      oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale metaproteome study of BGPs. 
      Proteotyping of BGPs reveals general correlations between the microbial community 
      structure and its function with process parameters. The monitoring of changes on 
      the level of microbial key functions or even of the microbial community 
      represents a well-directed tool for the identification of process problems and 
      disturbances.Graphical abstractCorrelation between the different orders and 
      process parameter, as well as principle component analysis of all investigated 
      biogas plants based on the identified metaproteins.

AB  - Ammonia inhibition represents a major operational issue for anaerobic digestion. 
      In order to refine our understanding of the terminal catabolic steps in 
      thermophilic anaerobic digestion under ammonia stress, we studied batch 
      thermophilic acetate fed experiments at low (0.26 g L(-1)) and high (7.00 g 
      L(-1)) Total Ammonia Nitrogen concentrations (TAN). Although methane production 
      started immediately for all incubations and resulted in methane yields close to 
      stoichiometric expectations, a 62-72% decrease of methanogenic rate was observed 
      throughout the incubation at 7.00 g L(-1) of TAN compared to 0.26 g L(-1). Stable 
      Isotope Probing analysis of active microbial communities in (13)C-acetate fed 
      experiments coupled to automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and 16S 
      rDNA pyrotag sequencing confirmed that microbial communities were similar for 
      both TAN conditions. At both TAN levels, the (13)C-labeled bacterial community 
      was mainly affiliated to Clostridia-relatives, with OPB54 bacteria being the most 
      abundant sequence in the heavy DNA 16S rDNA pyrotag library. Sequences closely 
      related to Methanosarcina thermophila were also abundantly retrieved in the heavy 
      DNA fractions, showing that this methanogen was still actively assimilating 
      labeled carbon from acetate at free ammonia nitrogen concentrations up to 916 mg 
      L(-1). Stable isotopic signature analysis of biogas, measured in unlabeled 
      acetate fed experiments that were conducted in parallel, confirmed that 
      acetoclastic methanogenic pathway was dominant at both ammonia concentrations. 
      Our work demonstrates that, besides the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway, 
      acetoclastic methanogenesis catalyzed by Methanosarcina can also play a major 
      role in methane production at high ammonia levels.

AB  - CO2 sequestration in deep-subsurface formations including oil reservoirs is a 
      potential measure to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, the 
      fate of the CO2 and the ecological influences in carbon dioxide capture and 
      storage (CDCS) facilities is not understood clearly. In the current study, the 
      fate of CO2 (in bicarbonate form; 0∼90 mM) with 10 mM of formate as electron 
      donor and carbon source was investigated with high-temperature production water 
      from oilfield in China. The isotope data showed that bicarbonate could be reduced 
      to methane by methanogens and major pathway of methanogenesis could be syntrophic 
      formate oxidation coupled with CO2 reduction and formate methanogenesis under the 
      anaerobic conditions. The bicarbonate addition induced the shift of microbial 
      community. Addition of bicarbonate and formate was associated with a decrease of 
      Methanosarcinales, but promotion of Methanobacteriales in all treatments. 
      Thermodesulfovibrio was the major group in all the samples and Thermacetogenium 
      dominated in the high bicarbonate treatments. The results indicated that CO2 from 
      CDCS could be transformed to methane and the possibility of microbial CO2 
      conversion for enhanced microbial energy recovery in oil reservoirs.

TI  - Bacterial and archeal dynamics of a labscale HYBRID gas fermentation bioreactor

LID - 10.1080/10934529.2019.1649589 [doi]
AB  - 16s rDNA-based methods were used in order to identify the dynamics of microbial 
      profiles in a HYBRID gas fermentation bio-methanization reactor. The effects of 
      various H(2) and CO(2) ratios on microbial community were investigated. The 
      HYBRID gas fermentation reactor was composed of granular anaerobic seed and the 
      system fed with only H(2) and CO(2) gases. No additional organic material and 
      trace element was fed during the throughout the experiments; thus, the microbial 
      diversity was directly related to production of methane. The dynamics of the 
      microbial communities were investigated with DGGE and real-time PCR analysis. The 
      results showed that Methanobacteriales members were more dominated than 
      Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales members in the system. DGGE results 
      indicated that Methanosaeta concilii, Methanoculleus sp., Methanosphaerula 
      palustris, Methanofollis formosanus, Methanolinea sp., and Methanobacterium 
      palustre were the most prominent methanogens depending on different H(2)/CO(2) 
      ratios. DGGE profiles suggested that hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic species 
      were responsible for the production of methane. The survival of syntrophic 
      bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens was attributed to their utilization of 
      organic materials provided by lysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
      first microbial profile detection study in a hybrid bioreactor system operated 
      with only pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

AB  - Alkaline wetlands distributed in arid or semi-arid areas are hotspots of methane 
      (CH(4)) emissions. Periods of drought and flood, although regular, are stressful 
      events encountered by methanogenic anaerobes in alkaline wetlands. To investigate 
      the response of the CH(4) cycle of alkaline wetlands to such stresses, we take 
      Zhalong wetland as an example, then determined the CH(4) flux and soil 
      microbiomes in the wetland during wet, dry, and flooded periods. The in-situ 
      CH(4) flux in the wet period was 9.55-17.29 mg‧m(-2)‧h(-1), but sharply degraded 
      to 3.37-6.61 mg‧m(-2)‧h(-1) in the dry period. It resumed to 
      4.51-20.80 mg‧m(-2)‧h(-1) when the wetland was flooded again, which indicated 
      that methanogenesis is quite resilient to drought. Syntrophic acetogenesis, and 
      subsequently aceticlastic methanogenesis, were the dominant methanogenic pathways 
      and resisted drought. Members belonging to Syntrophobacterales were the dominant 
      syntrophic acetogens. They enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state to 
      resist drought. The dominant Methanosarcinales have the ability to repair 
      reactive oxygen species damage during dry periods. The community of CH(4) sink 
      was governed by anaerobic methanotrophs, which entered a VBNC state or used 
      repair systems to survive dry periods. This study revealed the responses of the 
      CH(4) cycle and microbial functional genes to drought and flood in alkaline 
      wetlands.

AB  - Conductive iron oxides (CIO) have been proved recently to facilitate the 
      anaerobic microbial syntrophy based on the direct interspecies electron transfer 
      (DIET) in batch experiments. However, the effect of CIO was always insignificant 
      in anaerobic digestion (AD) reactor especially when the DIET-based syntrophic 
      partners were absent. In this study, the effect of magnetite on performance of AD 
      system with sucrose as a sole carbon source was investigated, but limited 
      enhancement was achieved during the first 36-day operation. The short-term effect 
      of ethanol addition was further studied in the magnetite-amended AD reactor, and 
      results showed that the AD reactor with 10gFe/L micro-sized magnetite (R3) 
      achieved higher performance of COD removal and methane proportion compared with 
      the other reactors (R1 without magnetite; R2 with 2gFe/L micro-sized magnetite; 
      R4 with 2gFe/L nano-sized magnetite). Meanwhile, the pyridoxine in extracellular 
      polymeric substances (EPS) and conductivity of anaerobic sludge from R3 increased 
      more significantly than those of the others. Analysis of high-throughput 
      sequencing indicated that the abundance of archaea increased in sludge from R3 
      and Methanosarcina responsible for DIET was dominant (63.64%). Additionally, the 
      abundance of potential electroactive bacteria Chloroflexi in R3 was 7.57-fold, 
      3.61-fold and 7.37-fold as that of R1, R2 and R4, respectively. These results 
      demonstrated that the electroactive microbes and methanogens could be enriched 
      efficiently in anaerobic sludge via synergetic effect of magnetite addition and 
      ethanol short-term stimulation.

AB  - Bioelectrochemical conversion of CO(2) to CH(4) is a promising way to increase 
      the calorific value of biogas produced during anaerobic digestion. There are two 
      groups of methanogens enriched in these systems, hydrogenotrophs and acetoclastic 
      methanogens that can also directly accept electrons from an electrode or another 
      microorganism. In this study, a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) poised at 
      -500 mV (vs. SHE) was operated for biogas upgrading. Methane content in the 
      biogas increased from 71% to >90%, and 8.2% of the CO(2) was converted to 
      methane. Methanothrix, an acetoclastic methanogen that can participate in direct 
      electron transfer (DET), and Azonexus, an acetate-oxidizing electrogen, were 
      enriched on the cathode. Transcriptomics revealed that Methanothrix on the 
      cathode were using the CO(2) reduction pathway, while Methanothrix in the bulk 
      sludge were using the acetate decarboxylation pathway for production of methane. 
      These results show that stimulation of DET in MEC enhances biogas-upgrading 
      processes.

TI  - Metabolic associations with archaea drive shifts in hydrogen isotope 
      fractionation in sulfate-reducing bacterial lipids in cocultures and methane

PG  - 462-77

AB  - Correlation between hydrogen isotope fractionation in fatty acids and carbon 
      metabolism in pure cultures of bacteria indicates the potential of biomarker D/H 
      analysis as a tool for diagnosing carbon substrate usage in environmental 
      samples. However, most environments, in particular anaerobic habitats, are built 
      from metabolic networks of micro-organisms rather than a single organism. The 
      effect of these networks on D/H of lipids has not been explored and may 
      complicate the interpretation of these analyses. Syntrophy represents an extreme 
      example of metabolic interdependence. Here, we analyzed the effect of metabolic 
      interactions on the D/H biosignatures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) using 
      both laboratory maintained cocultures of the methanogen Methanosarcina 
      acetivorans and the SRB Desulfococcus multivorans in addition to environmental 
      samples harboring uncultured syntrophic consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing 
      archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria (SRB) recovered from 
      deep-sea methane seeps. Consistent with previously reported trends, we observed a 
      ~80‰ range in hydrogen isotope fractionation (ε(lipid-water)) for D. multivorans 
      grown under different carbon assimilation conditions, with more D-enriched values 
      associated with heterotrophic growth. In contrast, for cocultures of D. 
      multivorans with M. acetivorans, we observed a reduced range of ε(lipid-water) 
      values (~36‰) across substrates with shifts of up to 61‰ compared to 
      monocultures. Sediment cores from methane seep settings in Hydrate Ridge 
      (offshore Oregon, USA) showed similar D-enrichment in diagnostic SRB fatty acids 
      coinciding with peaks in ANME/SRB consortia concentration suggesting that 
      metabolic associations are connected to the observed shifts in ε(lipid-water) 
      values.

AB  - A combination of acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis has been 
      previously identified to enable high-rate methanogenesis at high temperatures (55 
      to 65°C), but this capability had not been linked to any key organisms. This 
      study combined RNA-stable isotope probing on 13C-labelled acetate and 16S 
      amplicon sequencing to identify the active micro-organisms involved in high-rate 
      methanogenesis. Active biomass was harvested from three bench-scale thermophilic 
      bioreactors treating waste activated sludge at 55, 60 and 65°C, and fed with 13-C 
      labelled and 12C-unlabelled acetate. Acetate uptake and cumulative methane 
      production were determined and kinetic parameters were estimated using 
      model-based analysis. Pyrosequencing performed on 13C- enriched samples indicated 
      that organisms accumulating labelled carbon were Coprothermobacter (all 
      temperatures between 55 and 65°C), acetoclastic Methanosarcina (55 to 60°C) and 
      hydrogenotrophic Methanothermobacter (60 to 65°C). The increased relative 
      abundance of Coprothermobacter with increased temperature corresponding with a 
      shift to syntrophic acetate oxidation identified this as a potentially key 
      oxidiser. Methanosarcina likely acts as both a hydrogen utilising and 
      acetoclastic methanogen at 55°C, and is replaced by Methanothermobacter as a 
      hydrogen utiliser at higher temperatures.

AB  - The newly discovered Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' (M. 
      nitroreducens), mediating nitrate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane, is an 
      important microorganism in linking carbon and nitrogen cycles. In order to 
      explore the diversity of M. nitroreducens-like archaea in various environmental 
      niches with advanced high-throughput sequencing, new primers based on alpha 
      subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase gene were designed. The PCR results 
      demonstrated that the new primers could effectively detect M. nitroreducens-like 
      archaea from an enrichment culture dominated by M. nitroreducens as well as 
      samples collected from a natural freshwater lake and a full-scale wastewater 
      treatment plant (WWTP). By high-throughput sequencing, more than 30,000 M. 
      nitroreducens-like sequences were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of these 
      sequences along with published sequences showed that M. nitroreducens-like 
      archaea could be divided into three sub-branches (named as Group A, Group B and 
      Group C in this study). Clear geographical difference was observed, with Group A 
      and Group B dominating samples in Queensland (Australia) and in European 
      ecosystems, respectively. Further quantitative PCR revealed that the M. 
      nitroreducens-like archaea were more abundant in WWTP than the freshwater lake. 
      The study provided a large number of sequences for M. nitroreducens-like archaeal 
      communities, thus expanded our understanding on the ecological diversity of M. 
      nitroreducens-like archaea.

AB  - The effect of trace element addition on anaerobic digestion of food industry- and 
      household waste was studied using two semi-continuous lab-scale reactors, one 
      (R30+) was supplied with Fe, Co and Ni, while the other (R30) acted as a control. 
      Tracer analysis illustrated that methane production from acetate proceeded 
      through syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) in both digesters. The effect of the 
      trace elements was also evaluated in batch assays to determine the capacity of 
      the microorganisms of the two digesters to degrade acetate, phenyl acetate, oleic 
      acid or propionate, butyrate and valerate provided as a cocktail. The trace 
      elements addition improved the performance of the process giving higher methane 
      yields during start-up and early operation and lower levels of mainly acetate and 
      propionate in the R30+ reactor. The batch assay showed that material from R30+ 
      gave effects on methane production from all substrates tested. Phenyl acetate was 
      observed to inhibit methane formation in the R30 but not in the R30+ assay. A 
      real-time PCR analysis targeting methanogens on the order level as well as three 
      SAO bacteria showed an increase in Methanosarcinales in the R30+ reactor over 
      time, even though SAO continuously was the dominating pathway for methane 
      production. Possibly, this increase explains the low VFA-levels and higher 
      degradation rates observed in the R30+ batch incubations. These results show that 
      the added trace elements affected the ability of the microflora to degrade VFAs 
      as well as oleic acid and phenyl acetate in a community, where acetate 
      utilization is dominated by SAO.

TI  - Discovery of extremely halophilic, methyl-reducing euryarchaea provides insights 
      into the evolutionary origin of methanogenesis.
PG  - 17081
LID - 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.81 [doi]
AB  - Methanogenic archaea are major players in the global carbon cycle and in the 
      biotechnology of anaerobic digestion. The phylum Euryarchaeota includes diverse 
      groups of methanogens that are interspersed with non-methanogenic lineages. So 
      far, methanogens inhabiting hypersaline environments have been identified only 
      within the order Methanosarcinales. We report the discovery of a deep 
      phylogenetic lineage of extremophilic methanogens in hypersaline lakes and 
      present analysis of two nearly complete genomes from this group. Within the 
      phylum Euryarchaeota, these isolates form a separate, class-level lineage 
      'Methanonatronarchaeia' that is most closely related to the class Halobacteria. 
      Similar to the Halobacteria, 'Methanonatronarchaeia' are extremely halophilic and 
      do not accumulate organic osmoprotectants. The high intracellular concentration 
      of potassium implies that 'Methanonatronarchaeia' employ the 'salt-in' 
      osmoprotection strategy. These methanogens are heterotrophic methyl-reducers that 
      use C(1)-methylated compounds as electron acceptors and formate or hydrogen as 
      electron donors. The genomes contain an incomplete and apparently inactivated set 
      of genes encoding the upper branch of methyl group oxidation to CO(2) as well as 
      membrane-bound heterodisulfide reductase and cytochromes. These features 
      differentiate 'Methanonatronarchaeia' from all known methyl-reducing methanogens. 
      The discovery of extremely halophilic, methyl-reducing methanogens related to 
      haloarchaea provides insights into the origin of methanogenesis and shows that 
      the strategies employed by methanogens to thrive in salt-saturating conditions 
      are not limited to the classical methylotrophic pathway.

TI  - Expression of a bacterial catalase in a strictly anaerobic methanogen 
      significantly increases tolerance to hydrogen peroxide but not oxygen.
PG  - 270-278

AB  - Haem-dependent catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that degrades H2O2, producing 
      H2O and O2, and is common in aerobes. Catalase is present in some strictly 
      anaerobic methane-producing archaea (methanogens), but the importance of catalase 
      to the antioxidant system of methanogens is poorly understood. We report here 
      that a survey of the sequenced genomes of methanogens revealed that the majority 
      of species lack genes encoding catalase. Moreover, Methanosarcina acetivorans is 
      a methanogen capable of synthesizing haem and encodes haem-dependent catalase in 
      its genome; yet, Methanosarcina acetivorans cells lack detectable catalase 
      activity. However, inducible expression of the haem-dependent catalase from 
      Escherichia coli (EcKatG) in the chromosome of Methanosarcina acetivorans 
      resulted in a 100-fold increase in the endogenous catalase activity compared with 
      uninduced cells. The increased catalase activity conferred a 10-fold increase in 
      the resistance of EcKatG-induced cells to H2O2 compared with uninduced cells. The 
      EcKatG-induced cells were also able to grow when exposed to levels of H2O2 that 
      inhibited or killed uninduced cells. However, despite the significant increase in 
      catalase activity, growth studies revealed that EcKatG-induced cells did not 
      exhibit increased tolerance to O2 compared with uninduced cells. These results 
      support the lack of catalase in the majority of methanogens, since methanogens 
      are more likely to encounter O2 rather than high concentrations of H2O2 in the 
      natural environment. Catalase appears to be a minor component of the antioxidant 
      system in methanogens, even those that are aerotolerant, including Methanosarcina 
      acetivorans. Importantly, the experimental approach used here demonstrated the 
      feasibility of engineering beneficial traits, such as H2O2 tolerance, in 
      methanogens.

AB  - The impact of temperature on the largely unresolved intermediary ecosystem 
      metabolism and associated unknown microbiota that link cellulose degradation and 
      methane production in soils of a moderately acidic (pH 4.5) fen was investigated. 
      Supplemental [(13) C]cellulose stimulated the accumulation of propionate, acetate 
      and carbon dioxide as well as initial methane production in anoxic peat soil 
      slurries at 15°C and 5°C. Accumulation of organic acids at 15°C was twice as fast 
      as that at 5°C. 16S rRNA [(13) C]cellulose stable isotope probing identified 
      novel unclassified Bacteria (79% identity to the next cultured relative 
      Fibrobacter succinogenes), unclassified Bacteroidetes (89% identity to 
      Prolixibacter bellariivorans), Porphyromonadaceae, Acidobacteriaceae and 
      Ruminococcaceae as main anaerobic degraders of cellulose-derived carbon at both 
      15°C and 5°C. Holophagaceae and Spirochaetaceae were more abundant at 15°C. 
      Clostridiaceae dominated the degradation of cellulose-derived carbon only at 5°C. 
      Methanosarcina was the dominant methanogenic taxa at both 15°C and 5°C. Relative 
      abundance of Methanocella increased at 15°C whereas that of Methanoregula and 
      Methanosaeta increased at 5°C. Thaumarchaeota closely related to Nitrosotalea 
      (presently not known to grow anaerobically) were abundant at 5°C but absent at 
      15°C indicating that Nitrosotalea sp. might be capable of anaerobic growth at low 
      temperatures in peat.

      basis) was 150 to 180 liters of CH4/kg of VS(added). According to 16S rRNA 
      pyrotag sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the 
      methanogenic community was dominated by members of the Methanosarcinaceae, which 
      have a high level of metabolic capability, including acetoclastic and 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Loss of function at an HRT of 2 days was 
      accompanied by a loss of the methanogens, according to pyrotag sequencing. The 
      two acetate conversion pathways, namely, acetoclastic methanogenesis and 
      syntrophic acetate oxidation, were quantified by stable carbon isotope ratio mass 
      spectrometry. The results showed that the majority of methane was generated by 
      nonacetoclastic pathways, both in the reactors and in off-line batch tests, 
      confirming that syntrophic acetate oxidation is a key pathway at elevated 
      temperatures. The proportion of methane due to acetate cleavage increased later 
      in the batch, and it is likely that stable oxidation in the continuous reactor 
      was maintained by application of the consistently low retention time.

TI  - Methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) gene-based investigation of methanogens in 
      the mudflat sediments of Yangtze River estuary, China.

AB  - Methanogen populations of an intertidal mudflat in the Yangtze River estuary of 
      China were investigated based on the methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) gene 
      using 454-pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qPCR). Samples were collected at six depths from three locations. In the qPCR 
      analyses, a mean depth-wise change of mcrA gene abundance was observed from (1.23 
      ± 0.13) × 10(7) to (1.16 ± 0.29) × 10(8) per g dried soil, which was inversely 
      correlated with the depletion of sulfate (R(2) = 0.74; α = 0.05) and salinity (R 
      (2) = 0.66; α = 0.05). The copy numbers of mcrA was at least 1 order of magnitude 
      higher than dissimilatory sulfate reductase B (dsrB) genes, likely indicating the 
      importance of methanogenesis at the mudflat. Sequences related to the orders 
      Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales and 
      the uncultured methanogens; Rice Cluster I (RC-I), Zoige cluster I (ZC-I) and 
      anaerobic methane oxidizing archaeal lineage-1 (ANME-1) were detected. 
      Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales dominated the entire sediment layers, 
      but detectable changes of proportions were observed with depth. The 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanomicrobiales slightly increased with depth 
      while Methanosarcinales showed the reverse. Chao1 and ACE richness estimators 
      revealed higher diversity of methanogens near the surface (0-10 cm) when compared 
      with the bottom sediments. The near-surface sediments were mainly dominated by 
      the family Methanosarcinaceae (45 %), which has members that can utilize 
      substrates that cannot be used by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Overall, current 
      data indicate that Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales are the most dominant 
      methanogens within the entire depth profile down to 100 cm, with higher abundance 
      and diversity of methanogens in the deeper and upper sediment layers, 
      respectively.

TI  - Molecular characterization of the thioredoxin system from Methanosarcina 
      acetivorans.
PG  - 4598-611
LID - 10.1111/febs.12964 [doi]
AB  - The thioredoxin system, composed of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and thioredoxin 
      (Trx), is widely distributed in nature, where it serves key roles in electron 
      transfer and in the defense against oxidative stress. Although recent evidence 
      reveals Trx homologues are almost universally present among the methane-producing 
      archaea (methanogens), a complete thioredoxin system has not been characterized 
      from any methanogen. We examined the phylogeny of Trx homologues among 
      methanogens and characterized the thioredoxin system from Methanosarcina 
      acetivorans. Phylogenetic analysis of Trx homologues from methanogens revealed 
      eight clades, with one clade containing Trxs broadly distributed among 
      methanogens. The Methanococci and Methanobacteria each contain one additional Trx 
      from another clade, respectively, whereas the Methanomicrobia contain an 
      additional five distinct Trxs. Methanosarcina acetivorans, a member of the 
      Methanomicrobia, contains a single TrxR (MaTrxR) and seven Trx homologues 
      (MaTrx1-7), with representatives from five of the methanogen Trx clades. Purified 
      recombinant MaTrxR had 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reductase and 
      oxidase activities. The apparent Km value for NADPH was 115-fold lower than that 
      for NADH, consistent with NADPH as the physiological electron donor to MaTrxR. 
      Purified recombinant MaTrx2, MaTrx6 and MaTrx7 exhibited dithiothreitol- and 
      lipoamide-dependent insulin disulfide reductase activities. However, only MaTrx7, 
      which is encoded adjacent to MaTrxR, could serve as a redox partner to MaTrxR. 
      These results reveal that M. acetivorans harbors at least three functional and 
      distinct Trxs, and a complete thioredoxin system composed of NADPH, MaTrxR and at 
      least MaTrx7. This is the first characterization of a complete thioredoxin system 
      from a methanogen, which provides a foundation to understand the system in 
      methanogens.

TI  - Biogeochemistry and biodiversity of methane cycling in subsurface marine 
      sediments (Skagerrak, Denmark).
PG  - 1146-61
AB  - This biogeochemical, molecular genetic and lipid biomarker study of sediments ( 
      approximately 4 m cores) from the Skagerrak (Denmark) investigated methane 
      cycling in a sediment with a clear sulfate-methane-transition zone (SMTZ) and 
      where CH(4) supply was by diffusion, rather than by advection, as in more 
      commonly studied seep sites. Sulfate reduction removed sulfate by 0.7 m and CH(4) 
      accumulated below. (14)C-radiotracer measurements demonstrated active H(2)/CO(2) 
      and acetate methanogenesis and anaerobic oxidation of CH(4) (AOM). Maximum AOM 
      rates occurred near the SMTZ ( approximately 3 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) at 0.75 m) but 
      also continued deeper, overall, at much lower rates. Maximum rates of H(2)/CO(2) 
      and acetate methanogenesis occurred below the SMTZ but H(2)/CO(2) methanogenesis 
      rates were x 10 those of acetate methanogenesis, and this was consistent with 
      initial values of (13)C-depleted CH(4) (delta(13)C c.-80 per thousand). Areal AOM 
      and methanogenic rates were similar ( approximately 1.7 mmol m(-2) day(-1)), 
      hence, CH(4) flux is finely balanced. A 16S rRNA gene library from 1.39 m 
      combined with methanogen (T-RFLP), bacterial (16S rRNA DGGE) and lipid biomarker 
      depth profiles showed the presence of populations similar to some seep sites: 
      ANME-2a (dominant), ANME-3, Methanomicrobiales, Methanosaeta Archaea, with 
      abundance changes with depth corresponding to changes in activities and 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Below the SMTZ to approximately 1.7 m CH(4) 
      became progressively more (13)C depleted (delta(13)C -82 per thousand) indicating 
      a zone of CH(4) recycling which was consistent with the presence of 
      (13)C-depleted archaeol (delta(13)C -55 per thousand). Pore water acetate 
      concentrations decreased in this zone (to approximately 5 microM), suggesting 
      that H(2), not acetate, was an important CH(4) cycling intermediate. The 
      potential biomarkers for AOM-associated SRB, non-isoprenoidal ether lipids, 
      increased below the SMTZ but this distribution reflected 16S rRNA gene sequences 
      for JS1 and OP8 bacteria rather than those of SRB. At this site peak rates of 
      methane production and consumption are spatially separated and seem to be 
      conducted by different archaeal groups. Also AOM is predominantly coupled to 
      sulfate reduction, unlike recent reports from some seep and gassy sediment sites.

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) has excellent CH(4) production performance, 
      however, CO(2) still remains in the produced biogas at high content. For 
      achieving in-situ CO(2) sequestration and thus upgrading biogas, mineral 
      carbonation was integrated into a MEC treating sludge hydrolysate. With 19 g/L 
      wollastonite addition, in-situ mineral CO(2) sequestration was achieved by 
      formation of calcite precipitates. CH(4) content in the biogas was increased by 
      5.1 % and reached 95.9 %, with CH(4) production improved by 16.9 %. In addition, 
      the removals of polysaccharide, protein, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the 
      MEC were increased by 4.4 %, 6.7 %, and 8.4 %, respectively. The generated 
      precipitates rarely accumulated on bio-cathode, and did not significantly affect 
      the morphology of cathode biofilm. However, integrating mineral carbonation 
      resulted in a higher relative abundance of Methanosarcina on anode and slightly 
      decreased the ratio of Methanobacterium to Methanosaeta on cathode, which should 
      be noticed. In conclusion, integrating mineral carbonation is an attractive way 
      to improve the performance of MEC by achieving in-situ CO(2) sequestration, 
      accompanied with CH(4) production enhancement.

      methanogenesis.

AB  - Utilizing stable carbon isotope data to account for aceticlastic and 
      non-aceticlastic pathways of methane generation, a model was created to describe 
      laboratory batch anaerobic decomposition of cellulosic materials (office paper 
      and cardboard). The total organic and inorganic carbon concentrations, methane 
      production volume, and methane and CO(2) partial pressure values were used for 
      the model calibration and validation. According to the fluorescent in situ 
      hybridization observations, three groups of methanogens including strictly 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens, strictly aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta 
      sp.) and Methanosarcina sp., consuming both acetate and H(2)/H(2)CO(3) as well as 
      acetate-oxidizing syntrophs, were considered. It was shown that temporary 
      inhibition of aceticlastic methanogens by non-ionized volatile fatty acids or 
      acidic pH was responsible for two-step methane production from office paper at 35 
      degrees C where during the first and second steps methane was generated mostly 
      from H(2)/H(2)CO(3) and acetate, respectively. Water saturated and unsaturated 
      cases were tested. According to the model, at the intermediate moisture (150%), 
      much lower methane production occurred because of full-time inhibition of 
      aceticlastic methanogens. At the lowest moisture, methane production was very low 
      because most likely hydrolysis was seriously inhibited. Simulations showed that 
      during cardboard and office paper biodegradation at 55 degrees C, 
      non-aceticlastic syntrophic oxidation by acetate-oxidizing syntrophs and 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the dominant methanogenic pathways.

AB  - Despite the knowledge on anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons and signature 
      metabolites in the oil reservoirs, little is known about the functioning microbes 
      and the related biochemical pathways involved, especially about the methanogenic 
      communities. In the present study, a methanogenic consortium enriched from 
      high-temperature oil reservoir production water and incubated at 55 °C with a 
      mixture of long chain n-alkanes (C(15)-C(20)) as the sole carbon and energy 
      sources was characterized. Biodegradation of n-alkanes was observed as methane 
      production in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment reached 141.47 μmol 
      above the controls after 749 days of incubation, corresponding to 17 % of the 
      theoretical total. GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of putative downstream 
      metabolites probably from the anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes and 
      indicating an incomplete conversion of the n-alkanes to methane. Enrichment 
      cultures taken at different incubation times were subjected to microbial 
      community analysis. Both 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and DGGE profiles showed 
      that alkanes-degrading community was dynamic during incubation. The dominant 
      bacterial species in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with Firmicutes 
      members clustering with thermophilic syntrophic bacteria of the genera Moorella 
      sp. and Gelria sp. Other represented within the bacterial community were members 
      of the Leptospiraceae, Thermodesulfobiaceae, Thermotogaceae, Chloroflexi, 
      Bacteroidetes and Candidate Division OP1. The archaeal community was 
      predominantly represented by members of the phyla Crenarchaeota and 
      Euryarchaeota. Corresponding sequences within the Euryarchaeota were associated 
      with methanogens clustering with orders Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales and 
      Methanobacteriales. On the other hand, PCR amplification for detection of 
      functional genes encoding the alkylsuccinate synthase α-subunit (assA) was 
      positive in the enrichment cultures. Moreover, the appearance of a new assA gene 
      sequence identified in day 749 supported the establishment of a functioning 
      microbial species in the enrichment. Our results indicate that n-alkanes are 
      converted to methane slowly by a microbial community enriched from oilfield 
      production water and fumarate addition is most likely the initial activation step 
      of n-alkanes degradation under thermophilic methanogenic conditions.

AB  - Recently, the influence of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) on methanogenesis in 
      anaerobic digestion has drawn much attention, however, the changes in NPs and 
      functioning consortia within the methanogenic community are usually not 
      investigated. Therefore, the methanogenesis performance, NPs transformation and 
      methanogenic community development in anaerobic digester sludge under MnO(2) NP 
      supplementation were demonstrated in this study. MnO(2) NPs (400 mg/gVSS) 
      stimulated the methane (CH(4)) yield by 42% for a final CH(4) proportion of 81.8% 
      of the total gas production. Meanwhile, the coenzyme F(420) and INT-electron 
      transport system activities showed positive correlation with MnO(2) 
      concentration. Microbial Mn reduction and oxidation occurred in conjunction with 
      methanogenesis, resulting in transformation of the shape of the MnO(2) NPs from 
      wire-like to globular particles. Microbial community analysis indicated that the 
      relative abundances of genera Methanobacterium, Methanosaeta, and Methanosarcina 
      were higher in the presence of MnO(2) NPs. Moreover, a new and different crucial 
      synergy within the methanogenic community was formed with low-abundance consortia 
      driving Mn respiration coupled to methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report on transformation of metal oxides NPs 
      combined with syntrophic community development in studies focusing on 
      methanogenesis in response to NPs.

AB  - Solid anaerobic digestion batch (SADB) with liquid digestate recirculation and 
      wet anaerobic digestion of organic waste were experimentally investigated. SADB 
      was operated at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 4.55kgVS/m(3)day, generating 
      about 252NL CH(4)/kgVS, whereas the wet digester was operated at an OLR of 
      0.9kgVS/m(3)day, generating about 320NL CH(4)/kgVS. The initial total volatile 
      fatty acids concentrations for SADB and wet digestion were about 12,500mg/L and 
      4500mg/L, respectively. There were higher concentrations of ammonium and COD for 
      the SADB compared to the wet one. The genomic analysis performed by high 
      throughput sequencing returned a number of sequences for each sample ranging from 
      110,619 to 373,307. More than 93% were assigned to the Bacteria domain. Seven and 
      nine major phyla were sequenced for the SADB and wet digestion, respectively, 
      with Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria being the dominant phyla in 
      both digesters. Taxonomic profiles suggested a methanogenic pathway characterized 
      by a relevant syntrophic acetate-oxidizing metabolism mainly in the liquid 
      digestate of the SADB. This result also confirms the benefits of liquid digestate 
      recirculation for improving the efficiency of AD performed with high solids 
      (>30%w/w) content.

AB  - The inhibitory effects of sulfide on microbial processes during anaerobic 
      digestion have been widely addressed. However, other effects of sulfide are less 
      explored, given that sulfide is a potential sulfur source for microorganisms and 
      its high reactivity triggers a suit of abiotic reactions. We demonstrated that 
      sulfide interaction with Fe regulates the dynamics and activities of microbial 
      community during anaerobic digestion. This was manifested by the S:Fe molar 
      ratio, whose increase adversely influenced the acetoclastic methanogens, 
      Methanosaeta, and turnover of acetate. Dynamics of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, 
      Methanoculleus and Methanobrevibacter, were presumably influenced by 
      sulfide-induced changes in the partial pressure of hydrogen. Interestingly, 
      conversion of the long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), oleate, to methane was enhanced 
      together with the abundance of LCFA-degrading, β-oxidizing Syntrophomonas at an 
      elevated S:Fe molar ratio. The results suggested that sulfur chemical speciation 
      is a controlling factor for microbial community functions in anaerobic digestion 
      processes.

TI  - Syntrophic oxidation of propionate in rice field soil at 15 and 30°C under 
      methanogenic conditions.
PG  - 4923-32
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00688-12 [doi]
AB  - Propionate is one of the major intermediary products in the anaerobic 
      decomposition of organic matter in wetlands and paddy fields. Under methanogenic 
      conditions, propionate is decomposed through syntrophic interaction between 
      proton-reducing and propionate-oxidizing bacteria and H(2)-consuming methanogens. 
      Temperature is an important environmental regulator; yet its effect on syntrophic 
      propionate oxidation has been poorly understood. In the present study, we 
      investigated the syntrophic oxidation of propionate in a rice field soil at 15°C 
      and 30°C. [U-(13)C]propionate (99 atom%) was applied to anoxic soil slurries, and 
      the bacteria and archaea assimilating (13)C were traced by DNA-based stable 
      isotope probing. Syntrophobacter spp., Pelotomaculum spp., and Smithella spp. 
      were found significantly incorporating (13)C into their nucleic acids after 
      [(13)C]propionate incubation at 30°C. The activity of Smithella spp. increased in 
      the later stage, and concurrently that of Syntrophomonas spp. increased. 
      Aceticlastic Methanosaetaceae and hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiales and 
      Methanocellales acted as methanogenic partners at 30°C. Syntrophic oxidation of 
      propionate also occurred actively at 15°C. Syntrophobacter spp. were 
      significantly labeled with (13)C, whereas Pelotomaculum spp. were less active at 
      this temperature. In addition, Methanomicrobiales, Methanocellales, and 
      Methanosarcinaceae dominated the methanogenic community, while Methanosaetaceae 
      decreased. Collectively, temperature markedly influenced the activity and 
      community structure of syntrophic guilds degrading propionate in the rice field 
      soil. Interestingly, Geobacter spp. and some other anaerobic organisms like 
      Rhodocyclaceae, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Thermomicrobia probably also 
      assimilated propionate-derived (13)C. The mechanisms for the involvement of these 
      organisms remain unclear.

TI  - Enrichment and cultivation of prokaryotes associated with the sulphate-methane 
      transition zone of diffusion-controlled sediments of Aarhus Bay, Denmark, under 
      heterotrophic conditions.
PG  - 248-63
LID - 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01109.x [doi]
AB  - The prokaryotic activity, diversity and culturability of diffusion-controlled 
      Aarhus Bay sediments, including the sulphate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), were 
      determined using a combination of geochemical, molecular (16S rRNA and mcrA 
      genes) and cultivation techniques. The SMTZ had elevated sulphate reduction and 
      anaerobic oxidation of methane, and enhanced cell numbers, but no active 
      methanogenesis. The prokaryotic population was similar to that in other SMTZs, 
      with Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, JS1, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, 
      ANME-1, MBG-D and MCG. Many of these groups were maintained in a heterotrophic 
      (10 mM glucose, acetate), sediment slurry with periodic low sulphate and acetate 
      additions (~2 mM). Other prokaryotes were also enriched including methanogens, 
      Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Synergistetes and TM6. This slurry was then inoculated 
      into a matrix of substrate and sulphate concentrations for further selective 
      enrichment. The results demonstrated that important SMTZ bacteria can be 
      maintained in a long-term, anaerobic culture under specific conditions. For 
      example, JS1 grew in a mixed culture with acetate or acetate/glucose plus 
      sulphate. Chloroflexi occurred in a mixed culture, including in the presence of 
      acetate, which had previously not been shown to be a Chloroflexi subphylum I 
      substrate, and was more dominant in a medium with seawater salt concentrations. 
      In contrast, archaeal diversity was reduced and limited to the orders 
      Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales. These results provide information about 
      the physiology of a range of SMTZ prokaryotes and shows that many can be 
      maintained and enriched under heterotrophic conditions, including those with few 
      or no cultivated representatives.

TI  - A conspicuous nickel protein in microbial mats that oxidize methane 
      anaerobically.
PG  - 878-81
AB  - Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments is an important 
      microbial process in the global carbon cycle and in control of greenhouse gas 
      emission. The responsible organisms supposedly reverse the reactions of 
      methanogenesis, but cultures providing biochemical proof of this have not been 
      isolated. Here we searched for AOM-associated cell components in microbial mats 
      from anoxic methane seeps in the Black Sea. These mats catalyse AOM rather than 
      carry out methanogenesis. We extracted a prominent nickel compound displaying the 
      same absorption spectrum as the nickel cofactor F430 of methyl-coenzyme M 
      reductase, the terminal enzyme of methanogenesis; however, the nickel compound 
      exhibited a higher molecular mass than F430. The apparent variant of F(430) was 
      part of an abundant protein that was purified from the mat and that consists of 
      three different subunits. Determined amino-terminal amino acid sequences matched 
      a gene locus cloned from the mat. Sequence analyses revealed similarities to 
      methyl-coenzyme M reductase from methanogenic archaea. The abundance of the 
      nickel protein (7% of extracted proteins) in the mat suggests an important role 
      in AOM.

TI  - Anaerobic growth of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A on carbon monoxide: an unusual 
      way of life for a methanogenic archaeon.
PG  - 16929-34
AB  - All methanogenic Archaea examined to date rely on methanogenesis as their sole 
      means of energy conservation. Among these are ones that use carbon monoxide as a 
      growth substrate, producing methane via a pathway that involves hydrogen as an 
      intermediate. To further examine the role of hydrogen in this process, we tested 
      the ability of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, a metabolically versatile 
      methanogen devoid of significant hydrogen metabolism, to use CO as a growth 
      substrate. M. acetivorans grew on CO to high cell densities (approximately 1 x 
      10(8) per ml) with a doubling time of approximately 24 h. Surprisingly, acetate 
      and formate, rather than methane, were the major metabolic end products as shown 
      by 13C NMR studies and enzymatic analysis of culture supernatants. Methane 
      formation surpassed acetate/formate formation only when the cultures entered 
      stationary growth phase, strongly suggesting that M. acetivorans conserves energy 
      by means of this acetogenic and formigenic process. Resting cell experiments 
      showed that methane production decreased linearly with increasing CO partial 
      pressures, consistent with inhibition of methanogenesis by CO. Transposon-induced 
      M. acetivorans mutants with lesions in the operon encoding phosphotransacetylase 
      and acetate kinase failed to use either acetate or CO as growth substrates, 
      indicating that these enzymes are required for both aceticlastic methanogenesis 
      and carboxidotrophic acetogenesis. These findings greatly extend our concept of 
      energy conservation and metabolic versatility in the methanogenic Archaea.

AB  - To investigate the potential effect of aged engineered nanoparticles (a-ENPs) on 
      sludge digestion performance, 150L pilot anaerobic digesters (AD) were fed with a 
      blend of primary and waste activated sludge spiked either with a mixture of 
      silver oxide, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide or a mixture of their equivalent 
      bulk metal salts to achieve a target concentration of 250, 2000, and 2800mgkg(-1) 
      dry weight, respectively. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) were 1.2 times higher in the 
      spiked digesters and significantly different (p=0.05) from the control 
      conditions. Specifically, isovaleric acid concentration was 2 times lower in the 
      control digester compared to the spiked digesters, whereas hydrogen sulfide was 2 
      times lower in the ENPs spiked digester indicating inhibitory effect on sulfate 
      reducing microorganisms. Based on the ether-linked isoprenoids concentration, the 
      total abundance of methanogens was 1.4 times lower in the ENPs spiked digester 
      than in the control and metal salt spiked digesters. Pyrosequencing indicated 80% 
      decrease in abundance and diversity of methanogens in ENPs spiked digester 
      compared to the control digester. Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina 
      barkeri were identified as nano-tolerant as their relative abundance increased by 
      a factor of 6 and 11, respectively, compared to the other digesters. The results 
      further provide compelling evidence on the resilience of Fusobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria and the Trojan horse-like effect of ENPs which offered a 
      competitive advantage to some organisms while reducing microbial abundance and 
      diversity.

TI  - Metabolite and enzyme profiles of glycogen metabolism in Methanococcoides 
      methylutens.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - When a buffered anaerobic cell suspension of Methanococcoides methylutens was 
      maintained under methanol-limited conditions, intracellular glycogen and hexose 
      phosphates were consumed rapidly and a very small amount of methane formed at 4 h 
      of a starvation period. When methanol was supplemented after a total of 20 h of 
      starvation, a reverse pattern was observed: the glycogen level and the hexose 
      phosphate pool increased, and formation of methane took place after a lag period 
      of 90 min. A considerable amount of methane was formed in 120 min after its 
      detection with a rate of 0.18 micromol mg(-1) protein min(-1). When methane 
      formation decreased after 270 min of incubation and finally came to a halt, 
      probably due to complete assimilation of supplemented methanol, the levels of 
      glycogen and hexose monophosphates decreased once again. However fructose 
      1,6-diphosphate levels showed a continuous increase even after exhaustion of 
      methane formation. In contrast to the hexose phosphate pool, levels of other 
      metabolites showed a small increase after addition of methanol. The enzyme 
      profile of glycogen metabolism showed relatively high levels of triose phosphate 
      isomerase. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reacted with NADPH with a 
      three-fold higher activity as compared to that with NADH.

TI  - DNA stable-isotope probing of oil sands tailings pond enrichment cultures reveals 
      different key players for toluene degradation under methanogenic and sulfidogenic 
      conditions.
LID - fiv039 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiv039 [doi]
AB  - Oil sands tailings ponds are anaerobic repositories of fluid wastes produced by 
      extraction of bitumen from oil sands ores. Diverse indigenous microbiota 
      biodegrade hydrocarbons (including toluene) in situ, producing methane, carbon 
      dioxide and/or hydrogen sulfide, depending on electron acceptor availability. 
      Stable-isotope probing of cultures enriched from tailings associated specific 
      taxa and functional genes to (13)C6- and (12)C7-toluene degradation under 
      methanogenic and sulfate-reducing conditions. Total DNA was subjected to 
      isopycnic ultracentrifugation followed by gradient fraction analysis using 
      terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and construction of 
      16S rRNA, benzylsuccinate synthase (bssA) and dissimilatory sulfite reductase 
      (dsrB) gene clone libraries. T-RFLP analysis plus sequencing and in silico 
      digestion of cloned taxonomic and functional genes revealed that Clostridiales, 
      particularly Desulfosporosinus (136 bp T-RF) contained bssA genes and were key 
      toluene degraders during methanogenesis dominated by Methanosaeta. 
      Deltaproteobacterial Desulfobulbaceae (157 bp T-RF) became dominant under 
      sulfidogenic conditions, likely because the Desulfosporosinus T-RF 136 apparently 
      lacks dsrB and therefore, unlike its close relatives, is presumed incapable of 
      dissimilatory sulfate reduction. We infer incomplete oxidation of toluene by 
      Desulfosporosinus in syntrophic association with Methanosaeta under methanogenic 
      conditions, and complete toluene oxidation by Desulfobulbaceae during sulfate 
      reduction.

TI  - Screening of anaerobic activities in sediments of an acidic environment: Tinto 
      River.
PG  - 829-39
LID - 10.1007/s00792-012-0478-4 [doi]
AB  - The Tinto River (Huelva, Spain) is a natural acidic rock drainage environment 
      produced by the bio-oxidation of metallic sulfides from the Iberian Pyritic Belt. 
      A geomicrobiological model of the different microbial cycles operating in the 
      sediments was recently developed through molecular biological methods, suggesting 
      the presence of iron reducers, methanogens, nitrate reducers and hydrogen 
      producers. In this study, we used a combination of molecular biological methods 
      and targeted enrichment incubations to validate this model and prove the 
      existence of those potential anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments of 
      Tinto River. Methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, denitrifying and hydrogen-producing 
      enrichments were all positive at pH between 5 and 7. Methanogenic enrichments 
      revealed the presence of methanogenic archaea belonging to the genera 
      Methanosarcina and Methanobrevibacter. Enrichments for sulfate-reducing 
      microorganisms were dominated by Desulfotomaculum spp. Denitrifying enrichments 
      showed a broad diversity of bacteria belonging to the genera Paenibacillus, 
      Bacillus, Sedimentibacter, Lysinibacillus, Delftia, Alcaligenes, Clostridium and 
      Desulfitobacterium. Hydrogen-producing enrichments were dominated by Clostridium 
      spp. These enrichments confirm the presence of anaerobic activities in the acidic 
      sediments of the Tinto River that are normally assumed to take place exclusively 
      at neutral pH.

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) consumption and methane (CH4) production in pure cultures of three 
      different methanogens were investigated during cultivation with 0, 0.2 and 4.21 
      μM added nickel (Ni). The results showed that the level of dissolved Ni in the 
      anaerobic growth medium did not notably affect CH4 production in the 
      cytochrome-free methanogenic species Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanoculleus 
      bourgensis MAB1, but affected CH4 formation rate in the cytochrome-containing 
      Methanosarcina barkeri grown on H2 and CO2. Methanosarcina barkeri also had the 
      highest amounts of Ni in its cells, indicating that more Ni is needed by 
      cytochrome-containing than by cytochrome-free methanogenic species. The 
      concentration of Ni affected threshold values of H2 partial pressure (pH2) for 
      all three methanogen species studied, with M. bourgensis MAB1 reaching pH2 values 
      as low as 0.1 Pa when Ni was available in amounts used in normal anaerobic growth 
      medium. To our knowledge, this is the lowest pH2 threshold recorded to date in 
      pure methanogen culture, which suggests that M.bourgensis MAB1 have a competitive 
      advantage over other species through its ability to grow at low H2 
      concentrations. Our study has implications for research on the H2-driven deep 
      subsurface biosphere and biogas reactor performance.

AB  - Methanogenesis can be inhibited by volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation and 
      sulfate during anaerobic wastewater treatment. In this study, effects of 
      ferroferric oxide (Fe(3)O(4)) on VFAs degradation and methanogenesis in 
      sulfate-containing environment were investigated. Methanogenesis in reactors with 
      or without sulfate were both favored through the addition of Fe(3)O(4). In 
      reactors without sulfate, the dosage of Fe(3)O(4) increased the maximum methane 
      production rate by 21.7% accompanied with faster acetate and propionate 
      degradation. Metagenomic analysis showed that Fe(3)O(4) mainly promoted electron 
      exchange between Mesotoga, Syntrophobacter, Smithella and Methanosaeta without 
      altering the syntrophic patterns. However, in the sulfate-containing reactor with 
      low methanogenic efficiency, syntrophic ethanol users and Methanosaeta were 
      replaced by sulfate-reducing bacteria and Methanosarcina, respectively. The 
      supplement of Fe(3)O(4) re-enriched the syntrophic partners inhibited by sulfate 
      and rebuilt a new syntrophic interaction with high efficiency similar to that in 
      sulfate-free environment, leading to better methanogenic performance in 
      sulfate-containing environment.

TI  - Characterization of methanogenic and prokaryotic assemblages based on mcrA and

AB  - The diversity of the methyl-coenzyme reductase A (mcrA) and 16S rRNA genes was 
      investigated in gas hydrate containing sediment from the Kazan mud volcano, 
      eastern Mediterranean Sea. mcrA was detected only at 15 and 20 cm below seafloor 
      (cmbsf) from a 40-cm long push core, while based on chemical profiles of methane, 
      sulfate, and sulfide, possible anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) depth was 
      inferred at 12-15 cmbsf. The phylogenetic relationships of the obtained mcrA, 
      archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes, showed that all the found sequences were 
      found in both depths and at similar relative abundances. mcrA diversity was low. 
      All sequences were related to the Methanosarcinales, with the most dominant 
      (77.2%) sequences falling in group mcrA-e. The 16S rRNA-based archaeal diversity 
      also revealed low diversity and clear dominance (72.8% of all archaeal 
      phylotypes) of the Methanosarcinales and, in particular, ANME-2c. Bacteria showed 
      higher diversity but 83.2% of the retrieved phylotypes from both sediment layers 
      belonged to the delta-Proteobacteria. These phylotypes fell in the SEEP-SRB1 
      putative AOM group. In addition, the rest of the less abundant phylotypes were 
      related to yet-uncultivated representatives of the Actinobacteria, 
      Spirochaetales, and candidate divisions OP11 and WS3 from gas hydrate-bearing 
      habitats. These phylotype patterns indicate that AOM is occurring in the 15 and 
      20 cmbsf sediment layers.

TI  - Transcriptomic and physiological insights into the robustness of long filamentous 
      cells of Methanosaeta harundinacea, prevalent in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket 
      granules.
PG  - 831-9
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03092-14 [doi]
AB  - Methanosaeta spp. are widely distributed in natural environments, and their 
      filamentous cells contribute significantly to sludge granulation and the good 
      performance of anaerobic reactors. A previous study indicated that Methanosaeta 
      harundinacea 6Ac displays a quorum sensing-regulated morphological transition 
      from short to long filaments, and more acetate is channeled into methane 
      production in long filaments, whereas more is channeled into biomass synthesis in 
      short filaments. Here, we performed transcriptomic and physiological analysis to 
      gain insights into active methanogenesis in long filaments of M. harundinacea 
      6Ac. Both RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
      indicated that transcription of the genes involved in aceticlastic methanogenesis 
      and energy metabolism was upregulated 1.2- to 10.3-fold in long filaments, while 
      transcription of the genes for the methyl oxidative shunt was upregulated in 
      short filaments. [2-(13)C]acetate trace experiments demonstrated that a 
      relatively higher portion of the acetate methyl group was oxidized to CO2 in 
      short filaments than in long filaments. The long filaments exhibited higher 
      catalase activity and oxygen tolerance than the short ones, which is consistent 
      with increased transcription of the oxidant-scavenging genes. Moreover, 
      transcription of genes for cell surface structures was upregulated in the long 
      filaments, and transmission electron microscopy revealed a thicker cell envelope 
      in the filaments. RNA-seq determined a >2-fold upregulation of a variety of 
      antistress genes in short filaments, like those encoding chaperones and DNA 
      repair systems, which implies that the short filaments can be stressed. This 
      study reveals the genetic basis for the prevalence of the long filamentous 
      morphology of M. harundinacea cells in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket granules.

TI  - Use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to investigate function and 
      phylogeny of sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in a UK estuary.
PG  - 361-71
LID - 10.1016/S0168-6496(03)00078-3 [doi]
AB  - Abstract Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) are 
      important anaerobic terminal oxidisers of organic matter. However, we have little 
      knowledge about the distribution and types of SRB and MA in the environment or 
      the functional role they play in situ. Here we have utilised sediment slurry 
      microcosms amended with ecologically significant substrates, including acetate 
      and hydrogen, and specific functional inhibitors, to identify the important SRB 
      and MA groups in two contrasting sites on a UK estuary. Substrate and inhibitor 
      additions had significant effects on methane production and on acetate and 
      sulphate consumption in the slurries. By using specific 16S-targeted 
      oligonucleotide probes we were able to link specific SRB and MA groups to the use 
      of the added substrates. Acetate consumption in the freshwater-dominated 
      sediments was mediated by Methanosarcinales under low-sulphate conditions and 
      Desulfobacter under the high-sulphate conditions that simulated a tidal 
      incursion. In the marine-dominated sediments, acetate consumption was linked to 
      Desulfobacter. Addition of trimethylamine, a non-competitive substrate for 
      methanogenesis, led to a large increase in Methanosarcinales signal in marine 
      slurries. Desulfobulbus was linked to non-sulphate-dependent H(2) consumption in 
      the freshwater sediments. The addition of sulphate to freshwater sediments 
      inhibited methane production and reduced signal from probes targeted to 
      Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales, while the addition of molybdate to 
      marine sediments inhibited Desulfobulbus and Desulfobacterium. These data 
      complement our understanding of the ecophysiology of the organisms detected and 
      make a firm connection between the capabilities of species, as observed in the 
      laboratory, to their roles in the environment.

TI  - Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methane production and methanogenic populations 
      in an acidic West-Siberian peat bog.
PG  - 1159-73
AB  - Sites in the West Siberian peat bog 'Bakchar' were acidic (pH 4.2-4.8), low in 
      nutrients, and emitted CH4 at rates of 0.2-1.5 mmol m(-2) h(-1). The vertical 
      profile of delta13CH4 and delta13CO2 dissolved in the porewater indicated 
      increasing isotope fractionation and thus increasing contribution of 
      H2/CO2-dependent methanogenesis with depth. The anaerobic microbial community at 
      30-50 cm below the water table produced CH4 with optimum activity at 20-25 
      degrees C and pH 5.0-5.5 respectively. Inhibition of methanogenesis with 
      2-bromo-ethane sulphonate showed that acetate, phenyl acetate, phenyl propionate 
      and caproate were important intermediates in the degradation pathway of organic 
      matter to CH4. Further degradation of these intermediates indicated that 62-72% 
      of the CH4 was ultimately derived from acetate, the remainder from H2/CO2. 
      Turnover times of [2-14C]acetate were on the order of 2 days (15, 25 degrees C) 
      and accounted for 60-65% of total CH4 production. Conversion of 14CO2 to 14CH4 
      accounted for 35-43% of total CH4 production. These results showed that 
      acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis operated closely at a ratio of 
      approximately 2 : 1 irrespective of the incubation temperature (4, 15 and 25 
      degrees C). The composition of the archaeal community was determined in the peat 
      samples by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis 
      and sequencing of amplified SSU rRNA gene fragments, and showed that members of 
      Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanosarcinaceae and Rice cluster II (RC-II) were present. 
      Other, presumably non-methanogenic archaeal clusters (group III, RC-IV, RC-V, 
      RC-VI) were also detected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that 
      the number of Bacteria decreased (from 24 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(7) cells per gram 
      peat) with depth (from 5 to 55 cm below the water table), whereas the numbers of 
      Archaea slightly increased (from 1 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(7) cells per gram peat). 
      Methanosarcina spp. accounted for about half of the archaeal cells. Our results 
      show that both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis are an integral 
      part of the CH4-producing pathway in acidic peat and were represented by 
      appropriate methanogenic populations.

TI  - Enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in coupling with methane production 
      using an electrochemical bioreactor.
PG  - 1665-71
AB  - Anaerobic digestion sludge was cultivated in an electrochemical bioreactor (ECB) 
      to enrich the hydrogenotrophic methanogens. A modified graphite felt cathode with 
      neutral red (NR-cathode) was charged with electrochemical reducing power 
      generated from a solar cell. The methane and carbon dioxide collected in a Teflon 
      bag from the ECB were more than 80 ml/l of reactant/day and less than 20 ml/l of 
      reactant/day, respectively, whereas the methane and carbon dioxide collected from 
      a conventional bioreactor (CB) was around 40 ml/l of reactant/day, respectively. 
      Moreover, the maximal volume ratios of methane to carbon dioxide (M/C ratio) 
      collected in the Teflon bag from the ECB and CB were 7 and 1, respectively. The 
      most predominant methanogens isolated from the CB on the 20th, 80th, and 150th 
      days of incubation were hydrogenotrophs. The methanogenic diversity analyzed by 
      temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of the 16S rDNA variable region 
      was higher in the ECB than in the CB. The DNA extracted from the TGGE bands was 
      more than 95% homologous with hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the CB. In 
      conclusion, the ECB was demonstrated as a useful system for enriching 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens and increasing the M/C ratio of the gas product.

TI  - Focused-Pulsed sludge pre-treatment increases the bacterial diversity and

AB  - The low yield of methane in anaerobic digestion systems represents a loss of 
      energy that can be captured as renewable energy when the input sludge is 
      pre-treated to make it more bioavailable. We investigated Focused-Pulsed (FP) 
      pre-treatment, which make complex biological solids more bioavailable by exposing 
      them to rapid pulses of a very strong electric field. We investigated how the 
      microbial ecology in full-scale anaerobic digesters was altered when the 
      digesters' methane production rate was significantly increased by FP 
      pre-treatment. Using clone libraries and quantitative PCR, we demonstrated a 
      shift in methanogenic genera to the acetate-cleaving Methanosaeta and away from 
      the H(2)-oxidizing Methanoculleus. In addition, the acetate concentration in the 
      effluent was very low, probably due to the dominance of Methanosaeta, which are 
      capable of scavenging low acetate concentrations. By analyzing 36,797 
      pyrosequencing tags from the V6 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, along with 
      archaeal and bacterial clone libraries and quantitative PCR, we compared the 
      microbial community composition before and after FP treatment. The bacterial 
      community became more diverse after FP pre-treatment and was populated more by 
      phylotypes associated with cellulose fermentation (Ruminococcus), scavenging of 
      biomass-derived organic carbon (Chloroflexi), and homo-acetogenesis (Treponema). 
      We interpret that, as the overall activity of the community was stimulated by 
      addition of more bioavailable organic matter, the bacterial community became more 
      phylogenetically diverse to take advantage of the added input of biodegradable 
      material and in response to the more efficient utilization of acetate by 
      Methanosaeta.

TI  - Electrochemical nutrient recovery enables ammonia toxicity control and biogas 
      desulfurization in anaerobic digestion.
PG  - 948-55
AB  - Organic waste streams can be valorized and reduced in volume with anaerobic 
      digestion (AD). An often-encountered key issue however is the high ammonium 
      (NH4(+)) content of certain waste streams. Ammonia (NH3), in equilibrium with 
      NH4(+), is a toxic compound to the methanogenic community, which limits the 
      organic loading rate and endangers process stability. An electrochemical system 
      (ES) linked to a digester could, besides recovering this nutrient, decrease NH3 
      toxicity through electrochemical extraction. Therefore, two digesters with and 
      without ES attached in the recirculation loop were operated to test whether the 
      ES could control NH3 toxicity. During periods of high ammonium loading rates, the 
      methane (CH4) production of the ES-coupled reactor was up to 4.5 times higher 
      compared to the control, which could be explained through simultaneous NH4(+) 
      extraction and electrochemical pH control. A nitrogen flux of 47 g N m(–2) 
      membrane d(–1) could be obtained in the ES-coupled reactor, resulting in a 
      current and removal efficiency of 38 ± 5% and 28 ± 2%, respectively, at an 
      electrochemical power input of 17 ± 2 kWh kg(–1) N. The anode also oxidized 
      sulfide, resulting in a significantly lower H2S emission via the biogas. Lastly, 
      limited methanogenic community dynamics pointed to a nonselective influence of 
      the different operational conditions.

AB  - Abstract A molecular phylogenetic approach was used to characterize the 
      composition of microbial communities from two gas hydrate sedimentary systems in 
      the Gulf of Mexico. Nucleic acids, extracted from sediments directly overlying 
      surface-breaching gas hydrate mounds collected from a research submersible (water 
      depth 550-575 m), were amplified with nine different 16S rDNA gene primer sets. 
      The polymerase chain reaction primers targeted microorganisms at the 
      domain-specific (Bacteria and Archaea) and group-specific (sulfate-reducing 
      bacteria (SRB) and putative anaerobic methane-oxidizing (ANME) archaea) level. 
      Amplicons were obtained with five of the nine primer sets including two of the 
      six SRB Groups (SRB Group 5 and Group 6) and used to generate five different 
      clone libraries. Analysis of 126 clones from the Archaea library revealed that 
      the sediments associated with naturally occurring gas hydrate harbored a low 
      diversity. Sequence analysis indicated the majority of archaeal clones were most 
      closely related to Methanosarcinales, Methanomicrobiales and distinct 
      phylogenetic lineages within the ANME groups. The most frequently recovered 
      phylotypes in the ANME library were related to either ANME-2 or 
      Methanomicrobiales. In contrast to the two archaeal libraries, bacterial 
      diversity was higher with the majority of the 126 bacterial clones most closely 
      related to uncultured clones dominated by the delta- and epsilon-Proteobacteria. 
      Interestingly, while 82% of the clones in the SRB Group 5 library were affiliated 
      with delta-Proteobacteria, the vast majority (83%) of clones in the SRB Group 6 
      library was affiliated with the Firmicutes. This is the first phylogenetic-based 
      description of microbial communities extant in methane-rich hydrate-associated 
      sediments from a hydrocarbon seep region in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - A wide variety of inhibitors can induce anaerobic digester disruption. To avoid 
      performance losses, support media can be used to mitigate inhibitions. However, 
      distinguishing the physico-chemical from the biological mechanisms of such 
      strategies remains delicate. In this framework, the impact of 10  g/L of 
      different types of zeolites and activated carbons (AC) on microbial community 
      dynamics during anaerobic digestion of biowaste in the presence of 1.3 g/L of 
      phenol was evaluated with 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. In the presence of AC, 
      methanogenesis inhibition was rapidly removed due to a decrease of phenol 
      concentration. This abiotic effect related to the physico-chemical properties of 
      AC led to increased final CH4 and CO2 productions by 29-31% compared to digesters 
      incubated without support. Interestingly, although zeolite did not adsorb phenol, 
      final CH4 and CO2 production reached comparable levels as with AC. Nevertheless, 
      compared to digesters incubated without support, methanogenesis lag phase 
      duration was less reduced in the presence of zeolites (5 ± 1 days) than in the 
      presence of activated carbons (12 ± 2 days). Both types of support induced biotic 
      effects. AC and zeolite both allowed the preservation of the major representative 
      archaeal genus of the non-inhibited ecosystem, Methanosarcina. By contrast, they 
      distinctly shaped bacterial populations. OTUs belonging to class W5 became 
      dominant at the expense of OTUs assigned to orders Clostridiales, Bacteroidales 
      and Anaerolinales in the presence of AC. Zeolite enhanced the implantation of 
      OTUs assigned to bacterial phylum Cloacimonetes. This study highlighted that 
      supports can induce biotic and abiotic effects within digesters inhibited with 
      phenol, showing potentialities to enhance anaerobic digestion stability under 
      disrupting conditions.

TI  - The stepwise evolution of early life driven by energy conservation.
PG  - 1286-92
AB  - Two main theories have emerged for the origin and early evolution of life based 
      on heterotrophic versus chemoautotrophic metabolisms. With the exception of a 
      role for CO, the theories have little common ground. Here we propose an 
      alternative theory for the early evolution of the cell which combines principal 
      features of the widely disparate theories. The theory is based on the extant 
      pathway for conversion of CO to methane and acetate, largely deduced from the 
      genomic analysis of the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans. In contrast to 
      current paradigms, we propose that an energy-conservation pathway was the major 
      force which powered and directed the early evolution of the cell. We envision the 
      proposed primitive energy-conservation pathway to have developed sometime after a 
      period of chemical evolution but prior to the establishment of diverse 
      protein-based anaerobic metabolisms. We further propose that energy conservation 
      played the predominant role in the later evolution of anaerobic metabolisms which 
      explains the origin and evolution of extant methanogenic pathways.

TI  - Diversity and distribution of methanogenic archaea in an anaerobic baffled

PG  - 137-43
AB  - The diversity and distribution of methanogenic archaea in a four-compartment 
      anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) treating sugar refinery wastewater were 
      investigated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
      (PCR-DGGE). At an organic loading rate of 5.33 kg COD/m3·day, the ABR could 
      perform steadily with the mean chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 94.8% and 
      the specific CH4 yield of 0.21 l/g COD(removed). The CH4 content in the biogas 
      was increased along the compartments, whereas the percentage of H2 was decreased, 
      indicating the distribution characteristics of the methanogens occurred 
      longitudinally down the ABR. A high phylogenetic and ecological diversity of 
      methanogens was found in the ABR, and all the detected methanogens were 
      classified into six groups, including Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, 
      Methanobacteriales, Crenarchaeota, Arc I, and Unidentified. Among the 
      methanogenic population, the acid-tolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogens including 
      Methanoregula and Methanosphaerula dominated the first two compartments. In the 
      last two compartments, the dominant methanogenic population was Methanosaeta, 
      which was the major acetate oxidizer under methanogenic conditions and could 
      promote the formation of granular sludge. The distribution of the 
      hydrogenotrophic (acid-tolerant) and acetotrophic methanogens in sequence along 
      the compartments allowed the ABR to perform more efficiently and steadily.

AB  - Microbial community composition and metabolic potential have been explored in 
      petroleum-hydrocarbon-contaminated sludge of an oil storage facility. 
      Culture-independent clone library-based 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed that the 
      bacterial community within the sludge was dominated by the members of 
      β-Proteobacteria (35%), followed by Firmicutes (13%), δ-Proteobacteria (11%), 
      Bacteroidetes (10%), Acidobacteria (6%), α-Proteobacteria (3%), Lentisphaerae 
      (2%), Spirochaetes (2%), and unclassified bacteria (5%), whereas the archaeal 
      community was composed of Thermoprotei (54%), Methanocellales (33%), 
      Methanosarcinales/Methanosaeta (8%) and Methanoculleus (1%) members. Methyl 
      coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) gene (a functional biomarker) analyses also 
      revealed predominance of hydrogenotrophic, methanogenic Archaea (Methanocellales, 
      Methanobacteriales and Methanoculleus members) over acetoclastic methanogens 
      (Methanosarcinales members). In order to explore the cultivable bacterial 
      population, a total of 28 resident strains were identified and characterized in 
      terms of their physiological and metabolic capabilities. Most of these could be 
      taxonomically affiliated to the members of the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, 
      Micrococcus, Brachybacterium, Aerococcus, and Zimmermannella, while two strains 
      were identified as Pseudomonas and Pseudoxanthomonas. Metabolic profiling 
      exhibited that majority of these isolates were capable of growing in presence of 
      a variety of petroleum hydrocarbons as sole source of carbon, tolerating 
      different heavy metals at higher concentrations (≥1 mM) and producing 
      biosurfactant during growth. Many strains could grow under a wide range of pH, 
      temperature, or salinity as well as under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 
      different electron acceptors and donors in the growth medium. Correlation between 
      the isolates and their metabolic properties was estimated by the unweighted pair 
      group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis. Overall observation indicated 
      the presence of diverse groups of microorganisms including hydrocarbonoclastic, 
      nitrate reducing, sulphate reducing, fermentative, syntrophic, methanogenic and 
      methane-oxidizing bacteria and Archaea within the sludge community, which can be 
      exploited for in situ bioremediation of the oily sludge.

TI  - Characterization of the iron-sulfur clusters in ferredoxin from acetate-grown 
      Methanosarcina thermophila.
PG  - 2689-93
AB  - Ferredoxin from Methanosarcina thermophila is an electron acceptor for the CO 
      dehydrogenase complex which decarbonylates acetyl-coenzyme A and oxidizes the 
      carbonyl group to carbon dioxide in the pathway for conversion of the methyl 
      group of acetate to methane (K. C. Terlesky and J. G. Ferry, J. Biol. Chem. 
      263:4080-4082, 1988). Resonance Raman spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic 
      resonance spectroelectrochemistry indicated that the ferredoxin contained two 
      [4Fe-4S] clusters per monomer of 6,790 Da, each with a midpoint potential of -407 
      mV. A [3Fe-4S] species, with a midpoint potential of +103 mV, was also detected 
      in the protein at high redox potentials. Quantitation of the [3Fe-4S] and 
      [4Fe-4S] centers revealed 0.4 and 2.1 spins per monomer, respectively. The 
      iron-sulfur clusters were unstable in the presence of air, and the rate of 
      cluster loss increased with increasing temperature. A ferredoxin preparation, 
      with a low spin quantitation of [4Fe-4S] centers, was treated with Fe2+ and S2-, 
      which resulted in an increase in [4Fe-4S] and a decrease in [3Fe-4S] clusters. 
      The results of these studies suggest the [3Fe-4S] species may be an artifact 
      formed from degradation of [4Fe-4S] clusters.

TI  - Salinity responses of benthic microbial communities in a solar saltern (Eilat, 
      Israel).
PG  - 1608-16
AB  - The salinity responses of cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfate 
      reducers, and methanogens from the laminated endoevaporitic community in the 
      solar salterns of Eilat, Israel, were studied in situ with oxygen microelectrodes 
      and in the laboratory in slurries. The optimum salinity for the sulfate reduction 
      rate in sediment slurries was between 100 and 120 per thousand, and sulfate 
      reduction was strongly inhibited at an in situ salinity of 215 per thousand. 
      Nevertheless, sulfate reduction was an important respiratory process in the 
      crust, and reoxidation of formed sulfide accounted for a major part of the oxygen 
      budget. Methanogens were well adapted to the in situ salinity but contributed 
      little to the anaerobic mineralization in the crust. In slurries with a salinity 
      of 180 per thousand or less, methanogens were inhibited by increased activity of 
      sulfate-reducing bacteria. Unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria metabolized 
      at near-optimum rates at the in situ salinity, whereas the optimum salinity for 
      anoxygenic phototrophs was between 100 and 120 per thousand.

TI  - Characterization of the metal centers of the corrinoid/iron-sulfur component of 
      the CO dehydrogenase enzyme complex from Methanosarcina thermophila by EPR 
      spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - The multienzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex from Methanosarcina 
      thermophila contains at least two protein components: a CO-oxidizing 
      nickel/iron-sulfur (Ni/Fe-S) component and a cobalt-containing 
      corrinoid/iron-sulfur component (Co/Fe-S). The CO dehydrogenase complex has been 
      shown to synthesize acetyl-CoA from CoA, CH3I, and CO as well as to cleave 
      acetyl-CoA into its methyl, carbonyl, and CoA components as the first step in the 
      catabolism of acetyl-CoA to methane and CO2. Presumed to serve as an acceptor of 
      the methyl group of acetyl-CoA en route to methane, the Co/Fe-S component 
      contains iron, acid-labile sulfur, and a corrinoid cofactor (factor III) that is 
      the site of methylation. Using EPR spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry, we 
      characterized the cobalt and Fe-S centers of the Co/Fe-S component. The redox and 
      EPR properties of the metal centers in the isolated Co/Fe-S component are similar 
      to those of the Co/Fe-S component in the CO dehydrogenase enzyme complex, a 
      result that indicates that any protein-protein interaction between components in 
      the complex has little influence on the properties of the metal centers. The 
      corrinoid is maintained in the base-off state with a formal equilibrium reduction 
      potential (E'o) at pH 7.8 of -486 mV for the Co2+/1+ couple that facilitates 
      reduction of the Co2+ state by approximately 12 kcal/mol relative to base-on 
      cobamides. The Co/Fe-S component also contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster with an 
      E'o at pH 7.8 of -502 mV, which is nearly isopotential with the Co2+/1+ couple of 
      the cobamide.

TI  - Effect of antimicrobial compounds tylosin and chlortetracycline during batch 
      anaerobic swine manure digestion.
PG  - 4740-50
LID - 10.1016/j.watres.2009.08.005 [doi]
AB  - Tylosin and chlortetracycline (CTC) are antimicrobial chemicals that are fed to 
      >45% of the US swine herds at therapeutic and sub-therapeutic dosages to enhance 
      growth rates and treat swine health problems. These compounds are poorly absorbed 
      during digestion so that the bioactive compound or metabolites are excreted. This 
      study investigated the degradation and stabilization of swine manure that 
      contained no additives and compared the observed processes with those of manure 
      containing either tylosin or CTC. The batch anaerobic incubation lasted 216 days. 
      The breakdown of insoluble organic matter through anaerobic hydrolysis reactions 
      was faster for manure containing CTC compared with tylosin or no-antimicrobial 
      treatments. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation, including acetate, butyrate, 
      and propionate, was greater for CTC-containing manure compared to tylosin and 
      no-antimicrobial treatments. The relative abundance of two aceticlastic 
      methanogens, Methanosaetaceae and Methanosarcinaceae spp., were less for CTC 
      manure than manure with no-antimicrobial treatment. In addition, generation of 
      methane and carbon dioxide was inhibited by 27.8% and 28.4%, respectively, due to 
      the presence of CTC. Tylosin effects on manure degradation were limited, however 
      the relative abundance of Methanosarcinaceae spp. was greater than found in the 
      CTC or no-antimicrobial manures. These data suggest that acetate and other C-1 
      VFA compounds would be effectively utilized during methanogenesis in the presence 
      of tylosin.

TI  - Combined monitoring of changes in delta13CH4 and archaeal community structure 
      during mesophilic methanization of municipal solid waste.

AB  - Reconstituted municipal solid waste (MSW) with varying contents of putrescible 
      and cellulosic waste was incubated anaerobically under mesophilic conditions. 
      Standard physicochemical parameters were monitored, together with stable isotopic 
      signatures of produced CH(4) and CO(2). delta(13)C values for CH(4) indicated a 
      change of methanogenic metabolism with time. CH(4) was predominantly produced 
      from H(2)/CO(2) at the beginning of the incubations. This period was associated 
      with important shifts in archaeal communities monitored by automated ribosomal 
      intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and FISH of oligonucleotidic probes targeting 
      specifically 16S rRNA gene of various methanogenic groups. The onset of the 
      active methane generation phase was characterized by an increase of 
      CH(4)delta(13)C, indicating a progressive shift toward an aceticlastic 
      metabolism. When the methane production levelled off, a decrease in the isotopic 
      signature was observed toward values characteristics of hydrogenotrophic 
      metabolism. ARISA profiles were, however, found to be stable from the beginning 
      of the active methane generation phase until the end of the experiment. FISH 
      observation indicated that members of the family Methanosarcinaceae were 
      predominant in the archaeal community during this period, suggesting that these 
      methanogens might exhibit a high metabolic versatility during methanization of 
      waste.

      isolated from marine tidal flat sediment.
PG  - 3416-23
LID - 10.1128/AEM.07484-11 [doi]
AB  - Among methanogens, only 2 genera, Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina, are known to 
      contribute to methanogenesis from acetate, and Methanosaeta is a specialist that 
      uses acetate specifically. However, Methanosaeta strains so far have mainly been 
      isolated from anaerobic digesters, despite the fact that it is widespread, not 
      only in anaerobic methanogenic reactors and freshwater environments, but also in 
      marine environments, based upon extensive 16S rRNA gene-cloning analyses. In this 
      study, we isolated an aceticlastic methanogen, designated strain 03d30q(T), from 
      a tidal flat sediment. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and mcrA genes 
      revealed that the isolate belongs to the genus Methanosaeta. Unlike the other 
      known Methanosaeta species, this isolate grows at Na(+) concentrations of 0.20 to 
      0.80 M, with an optimum concentration of 0.28 M. Quantitative estimation using 
      real-time PCR detected the 16S rRNA gene of the genus Methanosaeta in the marine 
      sediment, and relative abundance ranged from 3.9% to 11.8% of the total archaeal 
      16S rRNA genes. In addition, the number of Methanosaeta organisms increased with 
      increasing depth and was much higher than that of Methanosarcina organisms, 
      suggesting that aceticlastic methanogens contribute to acetate metabolism to a 
      greater extent than previously thought in marine environments, where 
      sulfate-reducing acetate oxidation prevails. This is the first report on marine 
      Methanosaeta species, and based on phylogenetic and characteristic studies, the 
      name "Methanosaeta pelagica" sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with 
      type strain 03d30q.

      methanogenesis and sulfate removal in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 
      with magnetite.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been widely applied in the treatment of industrial 
      wastewater containing oxidized sulfur compounds. However, the production of 
      hydrogen sulfide usually limits the syntrophic metabolism proceeded by 
      interspecies hydrogen transfer (IHT), due to its corrosive and toxic properties. 
      The current study was in an attempt to establish direct interspecies electron 
      transfer (DIET) to resist the toxic inhibition from hydrogen sulfide and keep 
      syntrophic metabolism stable. The results showed that, in the presence of 
      magnetite, the methane production was improved about 3-10 folds at each ratio of 
      COD/SO(4)(2-), while the enhancement of methanogenesis had almost no negative 
      effect on sulfate reduction. With magnetite, the sludge conductance increased 
      about 3 folds, but the concentration of c-type cytochromes decreased, suggesting 
      that the potential DIET via both electrically conductive pili and outer surface 
      c-type cytochromes was established. Microbial community revealed that, 
      Veillonella species, the Fe(III)-reducing genus capable of reducing sulfate to 
      hydrogen sulfide, were specially enriched with magnetite. Together with the 
      relatively higher abundance of Methanothrix and Methanosarcina species, the novel 
      DIET between Fe(III)/sulfate-reducing genus and methanogens was inferred to be 
      responsible for the synergetic enhancement of methanogenesis and sulfate removal.

LID - 10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.04.019 [doi]
AB  - Performance and microbial population dynamics in landfill bioreactors were 
      investigated in laboratory experiments. Three reactors were operated without 
      aeration (control reactor, CR), with cyclic 6-h aeration and 6-h non-aeration 
      (intermittently aerated reactor, IAR), and with continuous aeration (continuously 
      aerated reactor, CAR). Each reactor was loaded with high-organic solid waste. The 
      performance of IAR was highest among the reactors up to day 90. The respective 
      solid weight, organic matter content, and waste volume on day 90 in the CR, IAR, 
      and CAR were 50.9, 39.1, and 47.5%; 46.5, 29.3 and 35.0%; and 69, 38, and 53% of 
      the initial values. Organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in leachate in the IAR 
      and the CAR showed significant decreases in comparison to those in the CR. The 
      most probable number (MPN) values of fungal 18S rDNA in the CAR and the IAR were 
      higher than those in the CR. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      analysis showed that unique and diverse eubacterial and archaeal communities were 
      formed in the IAR. The intermittent aeration strategy was favorable for 
      initiation of solubilization of organic matter by the aerobic fungal populations 
      and the reduction of the acid formation phase. Then the anaerobic H(2)-producing 
      bacteria Clostridium became dominant in the IAR. Sulfate-reducing bacteria, which 
      cannot use acetate/sulfate but which instead use various organics/sulfate as the 
      electron donor/acceptor were also dominant in the IAR. Consequently, 
      Methanosarcinales, which are acetate-utilizing methanogens, became the dominant 
      archaea in the IAR, where high methane production was observed.

AB  - A pilot-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) treating swine wastewater 
      was operated for 382 days to evaluate the process performance and methanogenic 
      population dynamics. A real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) was used to detect and 
      quantify the 16S rRNA gene concentrations of the domain Archaea, the four 
      methanogenic orders, and the two aceticlastic families. Extended intervals of 
      consistently stable and efficient wastewater treatment with a final hydraulic 
      retention time (HRT) of 3.5 days were sustained. A high abundance of 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens was observed, with Methanobacteriales as the major 
      group, suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, with the syntrophic 
      oxidation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), was a major route of methane formation. 
      This phenomenon was mainly attributed to the high ammonium concentration in swine 
      wastewater, which has a severe inhibitory effect mainly on aceticlastic 
      methanogens. Although there was no significant growth of Methanosaetaceae, its 
      abundance contributed to the formation and maintenance of granule.

      digestion by stable carbon isotopic signature of CH4].
PG  - 3252-7
AB  - The methanogenic pathway during anaerobic digestion of household waste was 
      investigated by stable carbon isotopic signature analysis, and testified by the 
      analysis of gas production, leachate characteristics and microbial fluorescence 
      in situ hybridization (FISH) methods. Furthemore, the difference of methanogenic 
      pathway between mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion was also 
      discussed. Results showed that under mesophilic conditions, the isotopic stable 
      carbon signature of CH4 (delta13 CH4) initially decreased to -69.5 per thousand, 
      indicating that CH4 was produced from CO2 and H2 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens. 
      When active CH4 production phase started, the delta13 CH4 values quickly 
      increased to -23.8 per thousand, which indicated more and more CH4 were formed by 
      aceticlastic methanogens, dominantly the family of Methanosarcinaceae, shown by 
      the FISH results. The delta13 CH4 values decreased successively and ultimately 
      remained at -55 per thousand, indicating that the fraction of aceticlastic 
      methanogenesis finally decreased to a steady level comparative with CO2-derived 
      methanogenesis at the steady slow methane production phase. Under thermophilic 
      conditions, the delta13 CH4 values remained at a level about -70 per thousand, 
      showing that methane were solely produced from CO2 reduction, and acetate 
      syntrophic oxidation happened during the active methane production phase.

AB  - The effect of bioaugmentation with different microorganisms on anaerobic 
      digestion to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem was investigated. Seven pure 
      strains of microorganisms (including obligate aceticlastic methanogen, 
      facultative aceticlastic methanogen, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, syntrophic 
      acetate oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation 
      approaches were tested. Bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen 
      Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) and SAOB Syntrophaceticu schinkii together was 
      the optimal choice, methane production (MP) was 71.1% higher than that in Blank, 
      the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greatly heightened according 
      to specific methanogenic activity analysis. Bioaugmentation with facultative 
      aceticlastic methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri (MSB) alone without SAOB addition 
      was also proven efficient (MP was 59.7% higher than that in Blank), both 
      aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were enhanced. Further 
      evaluation with carbon isotope fractionations analysis indicated that balancing 
      the activities of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways is 
      of great importance. 16s rRNA gene sequencing results showed that 
      Methanobacterium spp. and Methanosaeta spp. were the dominant archaea in all 14 
      reactors. Nevertheless, bioaugmentation with Methanosaeta spp. did not result in 
      a positive effect on MP. On the other hand, Methanobrevibacter spp. and 
      Methanosarcina spp. were non-dominant archaea (even after bioaugmentation with 
      MBS or MSB, the relative abundances were still poor (<2%)), but displayed pivotal 
      roles in determining the overall microbial consortium and, in turn, improved the 
      overall performance.

AB  - The effects of anaerobic co-digestion of waste-mixed sludge with fruit and 
      vegetable waste (FVW) on the methane generation of a mesophilic digester was 
      investigated. Organic loading rates (OLR) were 1.46kgVS/m(3)day, 2.1kgVS/m(3)day 
      and 2.8kgVS/m(3)day. Increase in the OLR due to FVW co-digestion caused 
      modification of the internal environment of the digester, mainly in terms of 
      N-NH4 (mg/L). Corresponding microbial populations were investigated by 
      metagenomic high-throughput sequencing. Maximum specific bio-methane generation 
      of 435 NLCH4 per kgVS feed was achieved for an OLR of 2.1kgVS/m(3)day, which 
      corresponded to a biomethane generation per kgVS removed of about 1700 NLCH4. In 
      these conditions the methanogenic pathway was dominated by aceticlastic 
      Methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic/aceticlastic Methanoscarcinae. Ammonia 
      concentration in the digester resulted a key parameter for enhancing syntrophic 
      acetate oxidation, enabling a balanced aceticlastic and 
      hydrogenotrophic/aceticlastic methanogenic pathway.

TI  - Layered structure of bacterial and archaeal communities and their in situ 
      activities in anaerobic granules.
PG  - 7300-7
AB  - The microbial community structure and spatial distribution of microorganisms and 
      their in situ activities in anaerobic granules were investigated by 16S rRNA 
      gene-based molecular techniques and microsensors for CH(4), H(2), pH, and the 
      oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). The 16S rRNA gene-cloning analysis revealed 
      that the clones related to the phyla Alphaproteobacteria (detection frequency, 
      51%), Firmicutes (20%), Chloroflexi (9%), and Betaproteobacteria (8%) dominated 
      the bacterial clone library, and the predominant clones in the archaeal clone 
      library were affiliated with Methanosaeta (73%). In situ hybridization with 
      oligonucleotide probes at the phylum level revealed that these microorganisms 
      were numerically abundant in the granule. A layered structure of microorganisms 
      was found in the granule, where Chloroflexi and Betaproteobacteria were present 
      in the outer shell of the granule, Firmicutes were found in the middle layer, and 
      aceticlastic Archaea were restricted to the inner layer. Microsensor measurements 
      for CH(4), H(2), pH, and ORP revealed that acid and H(2) production occurred in 
      the upper part of the granule, below which H(2) consumption and CH(4) production 
      were detected. Direct comparison of the in situ activity distribution with the 
      spatial distribution of the microorganisms implied that Chloroflexi contributed 
      to the degradation of complex organic compounds in the outermost layer, H(2) was 
      produced mainly by Firmicutes in the middle layer, and Methanosaeta produced 
      CH(4) in the inner layer. We determined the effective diffusion coefficient for 
      H(2) in the anaerobic granules to be 2.66 x 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1), which was 57% in 
      water.

PG  - 1231-42
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2009.67 [doi]
AB  - Granular biomass was temporally sampled from a cold (4-15 degrees C) anaerobic 
      bioreactor, which was inoculated with mesophilic biomass and used to treat 
      industrial wastewater in a long-term (3.4 year) study. Data from 16S rRNA gene 
      clone libraries, quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism analyses indicated that microbial community structure was dynamic, 
      with shifts in the archaeal and bacterial communities' structures observed 
      following start-up and during temperature decreases from 15 to 9.5 degrees C 
      (phase 1). Specifically, the relative abundance of architecturally important 
      Methanosaeta-like (acetoclastic) methanogens decreased, which was concomitant 
      with granule disintegration and the development of a putatively psychrophilic 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community. Genetic fingerprinting suggested the 
      development of a psychroactive methanogenic community between 4 and 10 degrees C 
      (phase 2), which was dominated by acetogenic bacteria and Methanocorpusculum-like 
      (hydrogenotrophic) methanogens. High levels of Methanosaeta-like acetoclastic 
      methanogens and granular biofilm integrity were maintained during phase 2. 
      Overall, decreasing temperature resulted in distinctly altered microbial 
      community structure during phase 1, and the development of a less dynamic 
      psychroactive methanogenic consortium during phase 2. Moreover, psychrophilic 
      H(2)-oxidizing methanogens emerged as important members of the psychroactive 
      consortia after >1200 days of low-temperature cultivation. The data suggest that 
      prolonged psychrophilic cultivation of mesophilic biomass can establish a 
      well-functioning psychroactive methanogenic consortium, thus highlighting the 
      potential of low-temperature anaerobic digestion technology.

TI  - Time-resolved DNA stable isotope probing links Desulfobacterales- and 
      Coriobacteriaceae-related bacteria to anaerobic degradation of benzene under 
      methanogenic conditions.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - To identify the microorganisms involved in benzene degradation, DNA-stable 
      isotope probing (SIP) with 13C-benzene was applied to a methanogenic 
      benzene-degrading enrichment culture. Pyrosequencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene 
      sequences revealed that the community structure was highly complex in spite of a 
      3-year incubation only with benzene. The culture degraded 98% of approximately 1 
      mM 13C-benzene and mineralized 72% of that within 63 d. The terminal restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of the buoyant density fractions 
      revealed the incorporation of 13C into two phylotypes after 64 d. These two 
      phylotypes were determined to be Desulfobacterales- and Coriobacteriaceae-related 
      bacteria by cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in the 13C-labeled DNA 
      abundant fraction. Comparative pyrosequencing analysis of the buoyant density 
      fractions of 12C- and 13C-labeled samples indicated the incorporation of 13C into 
      three bacterial and one archaeal OTUs related to Desulfobacterales, 
      Coriobacteriales, Rhodocyclaceae, and Methanosarcinales. The first two OTUs 
      included the bacteria detected by T-RFLP-cloning-sequencing analysis. 
      Furthermore, time-resolved SIP analysis confirmed that the activity of all these 
      microbes appeared at the earliest stage of degradation. In this methanogenic 
      culture, Desulfobacterales- and Coriobacteriaceae-related bacteria were most 
      likely to be the major benzene degraders.

TI  - Biphasic biomethanation of wood-hydrolysate effluent.
PG  - 461-7
AB  - The dissolving pulp industry, spread throughout the world, is the principal 
      source of wood-hydrolysate effluent rich in hemicelluloses. This effluent is the 
      major source of pollution in the industry. COD and BOD5 values of the effluent 
      range from 60,000 to 103,000 and 42,000 to 78,000 mg/l respectively. 
      Biomethanation of this effluent is the best possible treatment option for 
      reducing the COD load and recovering the bioenergy embedded in the effluent. This 
      paper deals with the study on the biphasic biomethanation of the wood-hydrolysate 
      in upflow acidogenic reactor coupled with anaerobic filter methanogenic reactor. 
      The two reactors were operated at organic loading rates of 69.6 and 30.1 g 
      COD/l/d respectively. The overall COD, hemicelluloses and lignin reductions, and 
      methane generation were observed to be 88%, 92%, 82% and 6.5 l/l reactor volume/d 
      respectively. The relative size of the biphasic, anaerobic filter (mono-phasic) 
      and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (mono-phasic) reactors is found to be 
      1:1.6:2.03 respectively.

AB  - This Study describes the feasibility of anaerobic degradation of United States 
      Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) listed 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol (4C-2-NP), 
      2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (2C-4-NP), 2-chloro-5-methylphenol (2C-5-MP) from a 
      simulated wastewater using four identical 7L bench scale hybrid up flow anaerobic 
      sludge blankets (HUASBs) at five different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) under 
      thermophilic condition (55+/-3 degrees C). The substrate to co-substrate ratios 
      were maintained between 1:33.3 and 1:166.6. Continuous monitoring of parameters 
      like pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation, oxidation reduction potential, 
      chemical oxygen demand (COD), alkalinity, gas productions, methane percentages 
      were carried out along with compound reduction to asses the efficiency of 
      biodegradation. The compound reduction was estimated by using spectrophotometric 
      methods and further validated with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
      Optimum HRT values were observed at 24h. Optimum ratio of substrate (phenolic 
      compounds) to co-substrate (glucose) was 1:100. Scanning electron micrographs 
      show that the granules were composed of thermophilic Methanobrevibacter and 
      thermophilic Methanothrix like bacteria.

PG  - 691-701
LID - 10.1002/bit.21933 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic methanethiol (MT) degradation by mesophilic (30 degrees C) alkaliphilic 
      (pH 10) communities was studied in a lab-scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Bed (UASB) 
      reactor inoculated with a mixture of sediments from the Wadden Sea (The 
      Netherlands), Soap Lake (Central Washington), and Russian soda lakes. MT 
      degradation started after 32 days of incubation. During the first 252 days, 
      complete degradation was achieved till a volumetric loading rate of 7.5 mmol 
      MT/L/day, and sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide were the main reaction 
      products. Temporary inhibition of MT degradation occurred after MT peak loads and 
      in the presence of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which is the autooxidation product 
      of MT. From day 252 onwards, methanol was dosed to the reactor as co-substrate at 
      a loading rate of 3-6 mmol/L/day to stimulate growth of methylotrophic 
      methanogens. Methanol was completely degraded and also a complete MT degradation 
      was achieved till a volumetric loading rate of 13 mmol MT/L/day (0.77 mmol 
      MT/gVSS/day). However, from day 354 till the end of the experimental run (day 
      365), acetate was formed and MT was not completely degraded anymore, indicating 
      that methanol-degrading homoacetogenic bacteria had partially outcompeted the 
      methanogenic MT-degrading archea. The archeal community in the reactor sludge was 
      analyzed by DGGE and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The methanogenic archea 
      responsible for the degradation of MT in the reactor were related to Methanolobus 
      oregonensis. A pure culture, named strain SODA, was obtained by serial dilutions 
      in medium containing both trimethyl amine and dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Strain SODA 
      degraded MT, DMS, trimethyl amine, and methanol. Flow sheet simulations revealed 
      that for sufficient MT removal from liquefied petroleum gas, the extraction and 
      biological degradation process should be operated above pH 9.

TI  - The competitive success of Methanomicrococcus blatticola, a dominant 
      methylotrophic methanogen in the cockroach hindgut, is supported by high 
      substrate affinities and favorable thermodynamics.
PG  - 266-75
AB  - Methanomicrococcus blatticola is an obligately anaerobic methanogen that derives 
      the energy for growth exclusively from the reduction of methylated compounds to 
      methane with molecular hydrogen as energy source. Competition for methanol 
      (concentration below 10 microM) and H(2) (concentration below 500 Pa), as well as 
      oxidative stress due to the presence of oxygen are likely to occur in the 
      peripheral region of the cockroach hindgut, the species' normal habitat. We 
      investigated the ecophysiological properties of M. blatticola to explain how it 
      can successfully compete for its methanogenic substrates. The organism showed 
      affinities for methanol (K(m)=5 microM; threshold<1 microM) and hydrogen 
      (K(m)=200 Pa; threshold <0.7 Pa) that are superior to other methylotrophic 
      methanogens (Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanosarcina barkeri) investigated 
      here. Thermodynamic considerations indicated that 'methanol respiration', i.e. 
      the use of methanol as the terminal electron acceptor, represents an attractive 
      mode of energy generation, especially at low hydrogen concentrations. 
      Methanomicrococcus blatticola exploits the opportunities by specific growth rates 
      (>0.2 h(-1)) and specific growth yields (up to 7 g of dry cells per mole of 
      methane formed) that are particularly high within the realm of mesophilic 
      methanogens. Upon oxygen exposure, part of the metabolic activity may be diverted 
      into oxygen removal, thus establishing appropriate anaerobic conditions for 
      survival and growth.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of niche partitioning between two anaerobic terminal 
      oxidizers of organic matter.

AB  - Understanding the ecological principles underlying the structure and function of 
      microbial communities remains an important goal for microbial ecology. We 
      examined two biogeochemically important taxa, the sulfate-reducing bacterial 
      genus, Desulfobulbus, and the methanogenic archaeal genus, Methanosaeta, to 
      compare and contrast niche partitioning by these two taxa that are ecologically 
      linked as anaerobic terminal oxidizers of organic material. An observational 
      approach utilizing functional gene pyrosequencing was combined with a 
      community-based reciprocal incubation experiment and characterization of a novel 
      Desulfobulbus isolate. To analyze the pyrosequencing data, we constructed a data 
      analysis pipeline, which we validated with several control data sets. For both 
      taxa, particular genotypes were clearly associated with certain portions of an 
      estuarine gradient, consistent with habitat or niche partitioning. Methanosaeta 
      genotypes were generally divided between those found almost exclusively in the 
      marine habitat (∼30% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)), and those which were 
      ubiquitously distributed across all or most of the estuary (∼70% of OTUs). In 
      contrast to this relatively monotonic distribution, for Desulfobulbus, there were 
      many more genotypes, and their distributions represented a wide range of inferred 
      niche widths from specialist genotypes found only at a single site, to ubiquitous 
      or generalist genotypes found in all 10 sites examined along the full estuarine 
      gradient. Incubation experiments clearly showed that, for both taxa, communities 
      from opposite ends of the estuary did not come to resemble one another, 
      regardless of the chemical environment. Growth of a Desulfobulbus isolated into 
      pure culture indicated that the potential niche of this organism is significantly 
      larger than the realized niche. We concluded that niche partitioning can be an 
      important force structuring microbial populations, with biotic and abiotic 
      components having very different effects depending on the physiology and ecology 
      of each taxon.

TI  - Evidence for aceticlastic methanogenesis in the presence of sulfate in a gas 
      condensate-contaminated aquifer.
PG  - 5348-53
AB  - The anaerobic metabolism of acetate was studied in sediments and groundwater from 
      a gas condensate-contaminated aquifer in an aquifer where geochemical evidence 
      implicated sulfate reduction and methanogenesis as the predominant terminal 
      electron-accepting processes. Most-probable-number tubes containing acetate and 
      microcosms containing either [2-(14)C]acetate or [U-(14)C]acetate produced higher 
      quantities of CH(4) compared to CO(2) in the presence or absence of 
      sulfate.(14)CH(4) accounted for 70 to 100% of the total labeled gas in the 
      [(14)C]acetate microcosms regardless of whether sulfate was present or not. 
      Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the acetate enrichments both with and 
      without sulfate using Archaea-specific primers showed identical predominant bands 
      that had 99% sequence similarity to members of Methanosaetaceae. Clone libraries 
      containing archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from sediment from the 
      contaminated portion of the aquifer showed that 180 of the 190 clones sequenced 
      belonged to the Methanosaetaceae. The production of methane and the high 
      frequency of sequences from the Methanosaetaceae in acetate enrichments with and 
      without sulfate indicate that aceticlastic methanogenesis was the predominant 
      fate of acetate at this site even though sulfate-reducing bacteria would be 
      expected to consume acetate in the presence of sulfate.

TI  - Characterization of microbial communities in anaerobic bioreactors using 
      molecular probes.
PG  - 297-308
AB  - The microbial community structure of twenty-one single-phase and one two-phase 
      full-scale anaerobic sewage sludge digesters was evaluated using oligonucleotide 
      probes complementary to conserved tracts of the 16S rRNAs of phylogenetically 
      defined groups of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria. These probe results 
      were interpreted in combination with results from traditional chemical analyses 
      and metabolic activity assays. It was determined that methanogens in "healthy" 
      mesophilic, single-phase sewage sludge digesters accounted for approximately 
      8-12% of the total community and that Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales 
      constituted the majority of the total methanogen population. Methanobacteriales 
      and Methanococcales played a relatively minor role in the digesters. Phylogenetic 
      groups of mesophilic, Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria were consistently 
      present at significant levels: Desulfovibrio and Desulfobulbus spp. were the 
      dominant sulfate-reducing populations, Desulfobacter and Desulfobacterium spp. 
      were present at lower levels, and Desulfosarcina, Desulfococcus, and 
      Desulfobotulus spp. were absent. Sulfate reduction by one or more of these 
      populations played a significant role in all digesters evaluated in this study. 
      In addition, sulfate-reducing bacteria played a role in favoring methanogenesis 
      by providing their substrates. The analysis of the two-phase digester indicated 
      that true phase separation was not accomplished: significant levels of active 
      methanogens were present in the first phase. It was determined that the dominant 
      populations in the second phase were different from those in the single-phase 
      digesters.

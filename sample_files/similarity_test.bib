  abstract={The perception of climate change mitigation efforts goes in wider and different phases, from individual incentives to community as a whole. Paris agreement conferences aim to delineate the climate change problem and strengthen the collaboration between the potential countries and developing countries which facing more challenges in terms of financial resource and socioeconomic. The agreement requires each country to implement their domestic climate policy which covers economic, social, and political issues in responding to climate change such as low carbon emission development plans, mitigation and adaptation measures, and climate resilience development. These climate actions are delivered as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which is a long-term achieving low-emissions plan and reflect the national GHG emission reduction priorities. This research explores the NDC in Thailand context with focus on the development of infrastructure construction sector which is a significant sector contribute to economic growth of the country. Thailand's Nationally Determined Contributions implements 15 climate long-term approaches for year 2021–2030 which covers to 3 categories: Energy and Transportation, Waste Management, and Industrial Manufacture and Product Application. In Thailand, likewise other countries, energy sector is the most contributor to the largest portion of GHG emission as it is interconnected with all activities including the focus area, construction of infrastructure. This research aims to analyze relevant approaches for construction sector indicated in the NDC Roadmap on Mitigation 2021–2030, and the Guidelines for driving and evaluating which includes the mitigation and adaptation measures on climate change. The construction sector by compliance with the NDCs approaches appears to be a potentially significant factor for sustainable development and low carbon future, likewise, building climate resilience through mitigation and adaptation practices, for instance, the application of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA), the construction rating system as a guideline for measuring sustainability in both building scale and component scale. In addition, to achieve the long-term goal, the participation and collaboration have to be bonded strongly in all phases to support climate action mechanisms in both domestic and international level.},

  title={Characteristics of CH4 Emission in Double Paddy Field Under Climate Change in Southern China Simulated by CMIP5 Climate Model Projections},
  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Methane (CH4) is one of the major agricultural greenhouse gases (GHG) which is mainly emitted from flooded paddy fields. Compared with single rice cultivation double rice cultivation has a longer growing season, which means it needs a longer flooding environment during rice growing, which led to more methane emission. There is a considerable area of double cropping rice in the southern China. Thus, it is necessary to map changes of CH4 emission in the paddy field of double cropping rice area under future climate change scenarios and investigate the sensitivity of CH4 emission from double paddy field to climate change. In this study, we employed Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) - a process-based biogeochemistry model- to simulate the CH4 emission from double paddy field and to analysis the influence of climate change on CH4 emission from double paddy field with simulation result. First, we utilized the historical meteorological data (source from Chinese Meteorological Data Center), soil data (source from The Harmonized World Soil Database) and observational data (sowing date, transplant date, harvest date, fertilizing rate, and cultivated area) from agrometeological stations during 1981 to 2010, to calibrate the library of rice varieties in the DNDC model. Then we employed the calibrated model to simulate the CH4 emission from double paddy field during 2041 to 2070(2050s) under RCP45 scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model projections. Finally, combining Geographic Information System (GIS) technology for regional scale simulation and mapping changes of CH4 emission in the main producing province of double cropping rice. The result indicates that there is a strong relationship between climate change and the CH4 emission. The emission result under climate change scenarios all has shown an increasing trend of methane emissions. Comparing several climate patterns, in Anhui, Hunan and Jiangxi have increased methane emissions by more than 25%; Fujian, Hubei, Yunnan and Zhejiang took second place, and the increase in methane emissions was still as high as 20%. Methane emissions from Fujian, Hubei, Yunnan and Zhejiang increased by more than 20%. Guangdong and Guangxi have increased by 14.5% and 16.5%, The smallest change in Hainan is 6.7%. Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between temperature change and methane emission at the spatial scale, indicating that climate warming has increased methane emissions. In addition, we did not consider the differences in rice varieties and field management between agro-ecological zone. These differences can be increased the uncertainty of the simulation results. We will consider it in the further studies.},

  abstract={Global climate change poses risks to human and natural systems on a global scale, while Vietnam is considered one of the regions experiencing heavy impacts of climate change. Thus, this study aims to determine the different perceptions, barriers, and driving parameters of local households to adapt to climate change. A total of 350 respondents in local regions were considered for the survey. The Multi-Logis Regression (MLS) model was applied to determine the driving parameters affecting the choice methods. A majority of farm households realized the huge impacts of climate change and actively planned to adapt. The findings also indicated that farm households applied widening solutions (11 methods) to adapt to climate change; importantly, production diversification was reported as the most important solution. While there was still a minor percentage that did not apply, at least a choice (6%). The results from the MLS model indicated that the adaptation process is driven positively and significantly by several factors, including age of the household head, gender of the household head, typology of household, and perception of climate change. Based on the research findings, a number of short- and long-term recommendations were developed to improve the efficiency of climate change adaptation and reduce the negative impacts of climate change at farm level.},

  abstract={The advent of fourth industrial revolution has come at a cost; our planet earth is enduring concurrent changes in population, increase in urban infrastructure, depleting natural resources, depleting forest covers, increase in pollution etc., and its cumulative ill effects on global climate. These changes coupled with advancements in technology viz. Sensors and Data Mining techniques have led to a growth in study of Climate Data as a method to thwart Climate Change. Climate change study is a data intensive subject which has seen numerous innovations in the data collection methods, and study of that data using Big Data Analytics. There has been a considerable shift from traditional study methods like random sampling of climate data to data intensive methods where complete datasets are analyzed by means of Big Data Analytics. The study of climate change and its effects has been one of the top priorities in Big Climate Data Analytics implementations and detailed research has been done covering a plethora of topics. However, the study of climate data by recent methods has revealed several challenges previously unrecorded in data mining literature, unless these challenges are addressed, big data analytics will not have the same meaningful impact that it has on other fields. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of use of Big Data in Climate Change research and the opportunities and challenges pertaining to it, by studying and summarizing the current state of applications of Big Data in Climate Science.},

  year={2017},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Climate change that coincides with global warming is generating enormous damages to many countries. The 2011 large-scale floods over the Chao Phraya River Basin is the worst floods ever recorded in Thailand, and the estimated damages by World Bank at US$ 46.5 billion. Although efforts have been made to mitigate the flood damage in the Chao Phraya River Basin through several structural measures, flooding still causes much more impact as a result of deforestation, farmland expansion and urban development. In this study, the impact of climate change on the discharge in the Chao Phraya River Basin is analyzed, using nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input (NARX) model. Future climate data were extracted from phase 3 and phase 5 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) under the greenhouse gas emission scenarios: B1, A2, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The future precipitation was downscaled using the Distribution Mapping. Using NARX, future monthly dischagre was predicted at Nakhon Sawan for the period 2010 - 2099. Depending on the emission scenario, the projected discharge for future periods are shown to increase in overall. However, there are decreasing discharge in the near future and the mid future periods under B1 emission scenario. These findings suggest that the risks of climate change in the Chao Phraya River Basin will affect on millions of people, social and environment.},

  abstract={The aim of the paper is to understand the perceptions of small-scale farmers in marginalized communities when it comes to the support that Information Communication Technology (ICTs) can provide them in their climate change management and monitoring efforts. Agriculture plays a key role in the socioeconomic development of marginalized communities. However, climate change has unfortunately affected the sustainability of agriculture in these communities. Elements of climate change such as inconsistent weather patterns, extreme temperature fluctuations and droughts, have added to the vulnerabilities that plague small-scale farmers. ICTs can be implemented as support tools, this way they can enhance the traditional knowledge and techniques that small-scale farmers have gained from past experiences. This study focuses on the perceptions of small-scale farmers towards the implementation of ICTs in their day-to-day farming activities.},

In this paper, the dynamic change of climate factors and the change characteristics of three types of grassland NDVI in the Maqu, and the relationships between the NDVI and the climatic factors were studied by using GIMMS NDVI data and meteorological data from January 1982 to December 2006 and the data of grassland types in the Maqu. The results showed that, the monthly temperature is increasing from 1982 to 2010 in the Maqu. There is no clear trend in the monthly or quarterly precipitation. The reference evapotranspiration trend for every month has displayed increasing trend. The NDVI for the most of the months were increasing in the growing season, with increase most significant in July and October. But the increase of NDVI in August was not significant. Among the three types of grassland, the NDVI in the Alpine grassland increased the most obviously and the trends for marshed grassland increased the least significantly. Climate change may be the main reason for the change of the NDVI. Human activities (such as overgrazing) was one of the reasons for the degradation of vegetation.},

This case study was completed to better understand changes occurring to the water balance of a major basin in Alberta. The Beaver River Basin is located in east central Alberta. Evidence indicates that the hydrology changed around the mid-1970s. To investigate this further, data from regional hydrometric and meteorological stations were assessed along with water well hydrographs and historical satellite images. A significant correlation was found to exist with a climate phenomenon known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Although the correlation appeared strong, changes to the land use also seemed to have an effect. Use of the local water resources was found to be of minor significance.},

  abstract={Agriculture, as a climate-dependent activity is highly susceptible to climate change. General Circulation Models (GCMs), representing physical processes in the atmosphere and land surface, are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the response of the global climate system to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Maize requires favorable temperature and precipitation conditions in its different phenological stages. This crop should be recommended in areas where it expresses its maximum yield potential. The objective of this work was to generate current and future CC scenarios with representative concentration routes (RCP) of GHGs to obtain the potential yield areas of maize. The climatic scenarios obtained show climatic variation, highlighting the increase in temperature and reduction in precipitation in various regions of the study area; however, the conditions for maize crop will be more favorable in some regions, since the area with high productive potential will increase over time. This is shown by the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 models used, with a significant increase in the area of high potential from 2021 to 2080; with the medium potential, we observed a reduction of cultivated area. Low potential surfaces only show an increase with the RCP 8.5 model.},

The paper discusses the potential impacts of climate change on arctic infrastructure including buildings, support systems and industrial facilities. Particular concerns are associated with permafrost warming and degradation, coastal erosion, the stability and maintenance of transportation routes, and industrial development. Adaptation, mitigation, and monitoring techniques will be necessary to minimize the potentially serious detrimental impacts. Climate change is likely to have significant impacts on existing Arctic infrastructure and on all future development in the region. In most cases, engineering solutions are available to address climate change impacts, thus the issue is more economic than technological. It is possible that the uncertainty associated with projections of future climate change will increase the cost of new projects in the Arctic, due to a conservative design approach.},

  abstract={Due to the complex climate types and various meteorological disasters in gansu province, with the background of climate change dominated by warming, the losses caused by meteorological disasters are increasing. The understanding of disaster risk characteristics and its response to climate change need to be solved urgently. In view of this, this study based on the data of the disaster situation of major meteorological stations in gansu province since 1961, constructed the disaster risk index-comprehensive loss rate, and systematically analyzed the space-time variation characteristics of drought, rainstorm and flood, wind and hail and low temperature disasters in gansu province, and discussed the impact of climate change on them. The results show that since 1961, the risk of agricultural drought disaster is the greatest, followed by wind hail and rainstorm flood, and the risk of cold disaster is relatively minimal. Among them, drought disaster, disaster and loss rate (25.2%, 14.1% and 2.2 %) were significantly higher than the national average (15.0%, 8.1 % and 1.7%), and the increase rate (0.16%/10a, 0.15%/10a and 0.05%/10a) was also higher than the national average. The comprehensive loss rates of storm hails, rainstorm and flood disasters and cold and cold disasters also showed an increasing trend, with the increase rates of 0.29%/10a, 0.45%/10 and 0.72%/10a, respectively. The characteristics of inter-decadal disaster risk change have obvious differences, and the drought disaster risk increases uniformly. After climate change, the risk of major meteorological disasters in gansu increased.},

  abstract={This study estimates the climate elasticity of runoff concerning precipitation and evaporation, in Kalu and Kelani river basins in the wet zone of Sri Lanka. The Ellagawa subbasin of Kalu river and Hanwella subbasin of Kelani river were selected for the assessment. The non-parametric estimator was selected based on the simplicity to assess the climate elasticity of runoff in the selected wet zone basins under current climate scenarios. The rainfall elasticity and evaporation elasticity were estimated for prevailing climate conditions. At the same time, the climate elasticity under synthetic climate change scenarios was assessed using a hydrological model. The HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model was selected based on the accessibility, flexibility, reliability, and data requirements to simulate streamflow. According to the model results, climate change results in causing -41% to 31% change in runoff in the Kalu river basin and -49% to 23% change in runoff in the Kelani river basin under synthetic climate change scenarios that have been developed for the period of 2016-2035 considering the predicted precipitation and evaporation changes comparative to the baseline period of 1986-2005.},

  abstract={This paper discusses the Climate Change impact on the Kingdom of Bahrain; and highlights the role of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on a local and global level to alleviate climate change through risk mitigation measures including the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, and adaptation. Also, explores the challenges of sea-level rise as faced by SIDS. The research is theoretical based in nature, it uses secondary data sources from internationally accredited institutions such as the World Bank, the UN, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The findings portray the overlap and interconnectedness of impacts of climate change for SIDS, where the warming of the seas leads to inundation of wetlands and low elevation coastal zones, salinization of freshwater resources and both combined lead to negative socioeconomic consequences. Thus, minimize the consequences of climate change and Sea Level Rise collective mitigation and adaptation responses need to be informed by vulnerability assessments, climate risk management and cost benefit analyses when being adopted to local policies. Financing of adaptation and mitigation measures for SIDS are discussed, where the importance of international aid and financing through funds. The research highlights the need to further investigate the comparisons and linkages between general environmental concerns and socioeconomic factors and solutions of SIDS with focus on Kingdom of Bahrain.},

  abstract={The most parts of the east of southwest China had suffered the most serious drought since meteorological data had been recorded in 2006. The wider range drought had lasted for a long time and brought severe economic losses in this area. This paper was to analyze changes and distribution of temperature and precipitation in southwest China in 2006. By using daily temperature and precipitation data from 80 observation stations in southwest China covering Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan from 1997 to 2006. The monthly average of temperature and precipitation were calculated by mathematical statistical methods and thematic maps were made by the software named ArcGIS 9.3. The characteristic of Climate Change was analyzed for the southwest drought. The result showed that in 2006 the precipitation was generally low, and the temperature was high and the drought was serious in most of southwest China, especially in Chongqing, from June to August. The highest monthly mean temperature and the lowest monthly mean precipitation had occurred in the central area of Chongqing in 2006. The high temperature had last eighty days and was obviously higher in June than that in other months in Chongqing, Bijie and Sinan in Guizhou province, Suining and Nanchong in Sichuan province, and the central of Chongqing was the highest temperature area. The precipitation was significantly low especially from the mid July to the beginning of September in the east of the study area. The most prominent drought took place in the total Chongqing Nanchong and Suining of Sichuan province. In 2006, snowfall reduced about 20% than that in former years on Tibetan plateau, and this situation went against the warm air from south to the eastern part in southwest China. The subtropical convection obviously activated the location of subtropical anticyclone which was located more northward and westward than that in previous years, and the continental high atmospheric pressure stability controlled the east of Sichuan and Chongqing. The cold air turned weak in North China. These drought factors in southwest China caused the less precipitation and the higher temperature, etc.},

  abstract={Tec21 is an educational model launched in August 2019 by Tecnologico de Monterrey, in Mexico. As part of students' Exploration stage elective course choices, the School of Engineering and Sciences offered, during the Fall 2020 term, a 5-week course on the topic of Causes, Consequences and Solutions to Climate Change (DS1002B), aimed at students 1) with no previous background or stated interest on the subject and 2) registered in a different school. The objective of this work was to assess the understanding and attitude of non-engineering, second-year undergraduate students toward the climate change crisis after taking the course DS1002B, in which students learn about the basic science of climate change science and acquire the following skills: 1) calculation of greenhouse gases emission inventories, 2) decision making of climate change mitigation and/or adaptation actions, and 3) reflect about the importance of creating awareness about climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the course was implemented online with the participation of270 students divided in 4 groups: 2 Regular-small-local (RSL) groups and 2 Elite- massive-national (EMN) groups, which differed in the number of attending professors, number of students, students' location, and language of instruction. The learning process was assessed in terms of attitude, confidence and source credibility. One of the main findings was that the number of students and language had no impact on learning motivation and attitude towards climate change. Also, a better understanding of the target audience will allow for increased engagement, perception and motivation, leading to more well-rounded future decision makers.},

  abstract={The African continent is most vulnerable to climate change due to a multitude of environmental stressors and low adaptive capacity. Climate change stresses agriculture via rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, as well as increased soil vulnerability, climate variability, pests and crop disease, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. Affordable greenhouse solutions work on a small, sustainable scale to mitigate some of the effects of climate change and provide strategies for smallholder farmers to adapt to the changing environment. Greenhouses cannot reverse climate change, but they are well suited to increase the adaptive capacity of the agricultural sector in developing nations. This article examines affordable greenhouses and the role they play in mitigating the effects of climate change for small-scale farmers.},

Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a bi-multivariate analysis method that has the potential to reveal complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. We present initial efforts on evaluating a few SCCA methods for brain imaging genetics. This includes a data synthesis method to create realistic imaging genetics data with known SNP-QT associations, application of three SCCA algorithms to the synthetic data, and comparative study of their performances. Our empirical results suggest, approximating covariance structure using an identity or diagonal matrix, an approach used in these SCCA algorithms, could limit the SCCA capability in identifying the underlying imaging genetics associations. An interesting future direction is to develop enhanced SCCA methods that effectively take into account the covariance structures in the imaging genetics data.},

The internet based application aids in the karyotyping learning of new geneticists. It has a theory section, MCQ tests based on the content and hands on learning on how to recognize and pair the chromosomes. Using a simple drag and drop system the program stops you from misplacing the chromosomes. It counts the number of false positioning attempts and the time you spend on each test, giving you a progress evaluation feedback. At the end of each test a pop up message appears containing the particularity of the arranged chromosome set (e.g.: deletion, inversions, duplications etc.). The application can be accessed at http://optimx.ro/ool/. This tool will help the future generation of geneticists develop their skills faster and give them more flexibility in their schedule.},

  abstract={Imaging genetics is a methodology for discovering associations between imaging and genetic variables. Many studies adopted sparse models such as sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) for imaging genetics. These methods are limited to modeling the linear imaging genetics relationship and cannot capture the non-linear high-level relationship between the explored variables. Deep learning approaches are under explored in imaging genetics, compared to their great successes in many other biomedical domains such as image segmentation and disease classification. In this work, we proposed a deep learning model to select genetic features that can explain the imaging features well. Our empirical study on simulated and real datasets demonstrated that our method outperformed the widely used SCCA method and was able to select important genetic features in a robust fashion. These promising results indicate our deep learning model has the potential to reveal new biomarkers to improve mechanistic understanding of the studied brain disorders.},

  abstract={Brain imaging genetics is an emerging research field to explore the underlying genetic architecture of brain structure and function measured by different imaging modalities. As a bi-multivariate technique for brain imaging genetics, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) has the good ability to identify complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. However, for most current brain imaging genetics with SCCA, there exist three main challenges for calculating accurate bi-multivariate relationships and selecting relevant features, i.e., nonlinearity, high-dimensionality (across all 4005 network edges between 90 brain regions), and a small number of subjects. We propose a novel deep self-reconstruction sparse canonical correlation analysis (DS-SCCA) for solving mentioned challenges in brain imaging genetics problems. Specifically, we employ deep network, i.e., multiple stacked layers of nonlinear transformation, as the kernel function, and learn the self-reconstruction matrix to reconstruct the original data at the top layer of the network. The parameters of our model are iteratively learned using parametric approach, augmented Lagrange method, and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Experimental results on ADNI dataset are given to demonstrate that our method produces improved cross-validation performances and biologically meaningful results.},

  abstract={Brain imaging genetics use the imaging quantitative traits (QTs) as intermediate endophenotypes to identify the genetic basis of the brain structure, function and abnormality. The regression and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) coupled with sparsity regularization are widely used in imaging genetics. The regression only selects relevant features for pre-chctors. SCCA overcomes this but is unsupervised and thus could not make use of the diagnosis information. We propose a novel method integrating regression and SCCA together to construct a supervised sparse bi-multivariate learning model. The regression part plays a role of providing guidance for imaging QTs selection, and the SCCA part is focused on selecting relevant genetic markets and imaging QTs. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the alternative search method. Our method obtains better feature selection results than both regression and SCCA on both synthetic and real neuroimaging data. This demonstrates that our method is a promising bi-multivariate tool for brain imaging genetics.},

  abstract={Recent advances in imaging genetics combine different types of data including medical images like functional MRI images and genetic data like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Many studies have proved that several mental diseases such as autism, ADHD, schizophrenia are affected by gene mutations. Understanding the complex interactions among these heterogeneous datasets may give rise to a new perspective for diseases diagnosis and prevention. In statistics, various graphical models have been proposed for the study of association networks with continuous data, binary data, and count data as well as the mixture of them. However, limited efforts have been made for the multinomial case, which has a direct application for SNP data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a latent Gaussian copula model for mixed data containing multinomial components, which fills a vacancy of graphical models in imaging genetics. The performance of the proposed methods is first numerically assessed through simulation studies. Then it is validated with fMRI and SNP data collected by the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) for a schizophrenia study.},

Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) is a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the ℓ1-norm or its variants. The ℓ0-norm is more desirable, which however remains unexplored since the ℓ0-norm minimization is NP-hard. In this paper, we impose the truncated ℓ1-norm to improve the performance of the ℓ1-norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose two efficient optimization algorithms and prove their convergence. The experimental results, compared with two benchmark methods, show that our method identifies better and meaningful canonical loading patterns in both simulated and real imaging genetic analyse.},

  abstract={Neuroimaging is an important research platform that can be very useful for eliciting new understanding on the complicated pathogenesis between genetics and disease phenotypes. Due to the extremely high dimensionality of image and genetic data, and considering the potential joint effect of genetic variants, multivariate techniques have been examined to detect Alzheimers disease (AD) related genetic variants expressed through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, the image features used in support of those methods are not immediately related to the disease, and the detected genetic markers may not be related to AD. In this study, we propose an ensemble model based framework for firstly extracting 50 region-based image features whose values are predicted by base learners trained on raw neuroimaging morphological variables. This task is followed by performing sparse Partial Least Squares regression (sPLS) method on the extracted 50 AD related image features and pre-selected 1508 SNPs to detect the significant SNPs associated with the extracted image features. Instead of modeling a direct link between genetic variants and disease label, we captured disease information indirectly.},

  abstract={Imaging genetics is a tool to extract genetic variants associated with both clinical phenotypes and imaging information. The approach can extract additional genetic variants compared to conventional approaches to better investigate various diseased conditions. Here, we applied imaging genetics to study Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to extract significant features derived from imaging genetics and neuroimaging. We built a regression model based on extracted significant features combining genetics and neuroimaging to better predict clinical scores of PD progression (i.e. MDS-UPDRS). Our model yielded high correlation (r = 0.697, p <; 0.001) and low root mean squared error (8.36) between predicted and actual MDS-UPDRS scores. Neuroimaging (from 123I-Ioflupane SPECT) predictors of regression model were computed from independent component analysis approach. Genetic features were computed using image genetics approach based on identified neuroimaging features as intermediate phenotypes. Joint modeling of neuroimaging and genetics could provide complementary information and thus have the potential to provide further insight into the pathophysiology of PD. Our model included newly found neuroimaging features and genetic variants which need further investigation.},

  abstract={Optimal representations of the genetic structure underlying complex neuroimaging phenotypes lie at the heart of our quest to discover the genetic code of the brain. Here, we suggest a strategy for achieving such a representation by decomposing the genetic covariance matrix of complex phenotypes into maximally heritable and genetically independent components. We show that such a representation can be approximated well with eigenvectors of the genetic covariance based on a large family study. Using 520 twin pairs from the QTIM dataset, we estimate 500 principal genetic components of 54,000 vertex-wise shape features representing fourteen subcortical regions. We show that our features maintain their desired properties in practice. Further, the genetic components are found to be significantly associated with the CLU and PICALM genes in an unrelated Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dataset. The same genes are not significantly associated with other volume and shape measures in this dataset.},

Here we investigate the use of sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to home in on sets of genetic variants that explain variance in a set of images. We extend recent work on penalized matrix decomposition to account for the correlations in both datasets. Such methods show promise in imaging genetics as they exploit the natural covariance in the datasets. They also avoid an astronomically heavy statistical correction for searching the whole genome and the entire image for promising associations.},

  abstract={Imaging genetics is an effective tool used to detect potential biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in imaging and genetic data. Most existing imaging genetics methods analyze the association between brain imaging quantitative traits (QTs) and genetic data [e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)] by using a linear model, ignoring correlations between a set of QTs and SNP groups, and disregarding the varied associations between longitudinal imaging QTs and SNPs. To solve these problems, we propose a novel temporal group sparsity regression and additive model (T-GSRAM) to identify associations between longitudinal imaging QTs and SNPs for detection of potential AD biomarkers. We first construct a nonparametric regression model to analyze the nonlinear association between QTs and SNPs, which can accurately model the complex influence of SNPs on QTs. We then use longitudinal QTs to identify the trajectory of imaging genetic patterns over time. Moreover, the SNP information of group and individual levels are incorporated into the proposed method to boost the power of biomarker detection. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the whole T-GSRAM model. We evaluated our method using simulation data and real data obtained from AD neuroimaging initiative. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of the receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve. Moreover, the detection of AD-related genes and QTs has been confirmed in previous studies, thereby further verifying the effectiveness of our approach and helping understand the genetic basis over time during disease progression.},

  abstract={Meta-analyses estimate a statistical effect size for a test or an analysis by combining results from multiple studies without necessarily having access to each individual study's raw data. Multi-site meta-analysis is crucial for imaging genetics, as single sites rarely have a sample size large enough to pick up effects of single genetic variants associated with brain measures. However, if raw data can be shared, combining data in a “mega-analysis” is thought to improve power and precision in estimating global effects. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI investigation, we use fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from 5 studies (total N=2,203 subjects, aged 9-85) to estimate heritability. We combine the studies through meta- and mega-analyses as well as a mixture of the two - combining some cohorts with mega-analysis and meta-analyzing the results with those of the remaining sites. A combination of mega- and meta-approaches may boost power compared to meta-analysis alone.},

  abstract={The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s declaration of racism as a public health concern is a step towards addressing health disparities and inequities in our society. The human genome project, launched 30 years ago, has transformed the way we think about ourselves as individuals and as a population. Several health informatics programs have successfully developed, distributed, and implemented genetics curricula into their programs ([2]; [3]). Yet race and genetics continue to be intertwined in complex and ambiguous ways which can present a challenge to the way we address and discuss issues around race and genetics with students.Therefore, health informatics students need a curriculum that 1) emphasizes that race is a social construct that is independent of genetics, 2) racism not race, lead to negative health impacts in communities of color and 3) epigenetics could be a primary channel that connects racism and genetics. Unlike genetics, epigenetics is a scientific study of how behavior and environment affect gene expression without altering DNA sequence [4]. Epigenetics evolved into describing how heritable traits could be due to changes in chemical modifications of DNA or of the structural and regulatory proteins bound to it. This highlights the importance of the environment and its effect on an organism and its stages of development. The UW MHIHIM program has included the topic of epigenetics into its Consumer and Population Health class for over three years, this has improved student discussions on distinguishing race, as a social and environmental construct, and genetics, as a biological feature. The inclusion of epigenetics has clarified how racism impacts a person’s and a population’s health.All of Us research which focuses on how biology, lifestyle and environment affect health [5] and the integration of precision medicine in public health, has urged us to comprehend the interplay among social, environmental, biological, and genetic drivers of health. Health informatics professionals will be asked to solve fundamental issues raised by this interplay to shape public health policies. Thus, epigenetics is the backbone upon which social determinants of health rest and dynamically shape the public’s health and would contribute greatly to health informatics programs when it comes to helping students better assess the population’s health and the underlying causes of a disease.},

We developed and tested an automatic tract labeling algorithm to segment anatomically meaningful tracts from diffusion weighted images. Our multi-atlas method incorporates information from multiple hand-labeled fiber tract atlases. In validations, we showed that the method outperformed the standard ROI-based labeling using a deformable, parcellated atlas. Finally, we show a high-throughput application of the method to genetic population studies. We use the sub-voxel diffusion information from fibers in the clustered tracts based on 105-gradient HARDI scans of 86 young normal twins. The whole workflow shows promise for larger population studies in the future.},

We present a wireframing process as a part of the agile software development process to build a web portal prototype for an Indonesia-based genetic testing service called DNAku. The approach in building the prototype used in this case is a part of the Agile Software Development Method. In brief, the wireframing stage resulted in this work consists of three main important outcomes. The first one is the use case diagram as a blueprint of this web-based system. A site map is then proposed as an extended version of the use case diagram which visualizes the whole pages with the links. Finally, based on this site map a series of page mock-ups are designed using Hyper Text Marking Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The result of the prototype can be used as the basis for the next development stage, which is the coding stage based on the collected feedback from users. Considering the continuous application development via the wireframing method by taking into account the cycle of feedbacks from involved parties, this approach can strengthen the infrastructure to sustain DTC genetic business model, which has a niche market in Indonesia.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},

  pages={23450-23462},
  abstract={Identification and delineation of craniofacial characteristics support the clinical and molecular diagnosis of genetic syndromes. Deep learning (DL) frameworks for syndrome identification from 2D facial images are trained on large clinical datasets using standard convolutional neural networks for classification. In contrast, despite the increased availability of 3D scanners in clinical setups, similar frameworks remain absent for 3D facial photographs. The main challenges involve working with smaller datasets and the need for DL operations applicable to 3D geometric data. Therefore, to date, most 3D methods refrain from working across multiple syndromic groups and/or are solely based on traditional machine learning. The first contribution of this work is the use of geometric deep learning with spiral convolutions in a triplet-loss architecture. This geometric encoding (GE) learns a lower dimensional metric space from 3D facial data that is used as input to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) performing multiclass classification. Benchmarking is done against principal component analysis (PCA), a common technique in 3D facial shape analysis, and related work based on 65 distinct 3D facial landmarks as input to LDA. The second contribution of this work involves a part-based implementation to 3D facial shape analysis and multi-class syndrome classification, and this is applied to both GE and PCA. Based on 1,786 3D facial photographs of controls and individuals from 13 different syndrome classes, a five-fold cross-validation was used to investigate both contributions. Results indicate that GE performs better than PCA as input to LDA, and this especially so for more compact (lower dimensional) spaces. In addition, a part-based approach increases performance significantly for both GE and PCA, with a more significant improvement for the latter. I.e., this contribution enhances the power of the dataset. Finally, and interestingly, according to ablation studies within the part-based approach, the upper lip is the most distinguishing facial segment for classifying genetic syndromes in our dataset, which follows clinical expectation. This work stimulates an enhanced use of advanced part-based geometric deep learning methods for 3D facial imaging in clinical genetics.},

  abstract={A new era of computational efficacy and problem-solving abilities has begun with the combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and computer science methods. It is crucial in modern computing to combine RNNs with methods from the field of computer science. RNNs bring a dynamic learning paradigm, making algorithms more efficient and flexible by allowing them to process sequential input and complicated dependencies. Their usefulness goes beyond one specific area of study, and into others such as optimization issues, recommendation systems, image processing, and natural language processing. RNNs serve a vital role in addressing the severe challenges that algorithms confront, including processing sequential input, identifying temporal connections, and optimizing in high-dimensional environments. By providing dynamic and adaptive modeling, RNNs aid algorithms in navigating these obstacles. Recurrent Neural Network-Based Optimization Algorithm (RNN-OA) is an innovative novel approach presented in this research. RNN-OA is an approach to algorithmic optimization that makes use of RNNs' dynamic learning capability. Mechanisms for selective data processing with attention, regularization methods for model stability, and interpretability improvements for openness are all a part of it. Quickening the process of optimization in many different types of problems is transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches. There are a wide variety of computer science fields where RNN-OA can be useful. Time-series analysis, language modeling, picture recognition, and recommendation systems all benefit greatly from its ability to handle sequential data. The efficacy, scalability, and robustness of the method are thoroughly evaluated by simulating various problem scenarios and data streams. The results of these simulations provide illumination for the benefits and drawbacks of RNN-OA, paving the way for its development toward actual application in algorithmic optimization.},

  abstract={Time series forecasting with additional spatial de-pendencies has attracted a tremendous amount of research interest in social sciences, due to its importance in modern real-world applications. The Graph Neural Networks (GNN) is one of the most exciting deep learning techniques among these spatio-temporal modeling approaches. Most existing spatio-temporal GNN frameworks are based on a two-step modeling process. In such scenario, spatial and temporal dependencies are modeled in separate steps, which lead to problems such as complex architecture design, hard to scale, etc. Targeting the shortcomings of existing studies, we take both spatial and temporal dependencies from another perspective, and consider them as two heterogeneous types of edges in the graph. We propose a unified spatio-temporal GNN framework that captures both dependencies in a single step. More specifically, for each node in the graph, a unified neural network component is designed to simultaneously extract information from its sur-rounding neighbors (spatial) and its past records (temporal), which enables much easier dependency aggregation with faster execution. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on various applications, including modeling smart cities and data-driven political science research.},

  abstract={Nowadays, a growing number of automation systems is applied in life science laboratories to increase the throughput and accuracy of the experiments. Meanwhile, complex investigations require cooperative work, which includes multiple automated workstations. In order to face the great challenge of the resource distribution, a hybrid scheduler is used to generate the time schedule before the execution and after an unexpected situation for the dynamic scheduling. The indicator, presented in this paper, can trigger the rescheduling procedure when the trigger conditions are satisfied and offer the transportation balance factor, which is the most important parameter for dynamic scheduling. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to learn the relationship between the system operation data and the transportation balance factor. Then the ANN can forecast the balance factor fast and accurately based on the real current data of the system operation. Finally, an experiment proves that the proposed method is suitable to trigger the dynamic scheduling and accurate to generate the balance factor for the rescheduling, which provides a correct solution based on the unexpected situation.},

From a mathematical point of view, such parameterizations can usually be considered as continuous mappings (continuous dependencies between true vectors). NNs are a generic tool for fast and accurate approximation of continuous mappings and, therefore, they can be used to replace primary parameterization algorithms. In addition to fast and accurate approximation to the primary parameterization, NN also provides the entire Jacobian for very little computation cost.},

  abstract={Deploying neural networks (NNs) in low-resource domains is challenging because of their high computing, memory, and power requirements.

Thus, we propose the counterexample-guided neural network quantization refinement (CEG4N) framework, which combines search-based quantization and equivalence checking. The former minimizes computational requirements, while the latter guarantees that the behavior of an NN does not change after quantization. We evaluate CEG4N on a diverse set of benchmarks, including large and small NNs. Our technique successfully quantizes the networks in the chosen evaluation set, while producing models with up to 163% better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract={In order to explore the dynamic characteristics of neural coding in the transmission of neural information in the brain, a model of neural network consisting of three neuronal populations is proposed in this paper using the theory of stochastic phase dynamics. Based on the model established, the neural phase synchronization motion and neural coding under spontaneous activity and stimulation are examined, for the case of varying network structure. Our analysis shows that, under the condition of spontaneous activity, the characteristics of phase neural coding are unrelated to the number of neurons participated in neural firing within the neuronal populations. The result of numerical simulation supports the existence of sparse coding within the brain, and verifies the crucial importance of the magnitudes of the coupling coefficients in neural information processing as well as the completely different information processing capability of neural information transmission in both serial and parallel couplings. The result also testifies that under external stimulation, the bigger the number of neurons in a neuronal population, the more the stimulation influences the phase synchronization motion and neural coding evolution in other neuronal populations. We verify numerically the experimental result in neurobiology that the reduction of the coupling coefficient between neuronal populations implies the enhancement of lateral inhibition function in neural networks, with the enhancement equivalent to depressing neuronal excitability threshold. Thus, the neuronal populations tend to have a stronger reaction under the same stimulation, and more neurons get excited, leading to more neurons participating in neural coding and phase synchronization motion.},

  abstract={With the vigorous development of big data and information technology, promoting science and technology resources opening and sharing (STROS) has become a promising strategy to develop national innovation capacity. China has established various STROS platforms (STROSP) at the national and regional levels to encourage resources and knowledge sharing. However, STROSP efficiency evaluation is challenged in a vague environment, in which subjective and imprecise information in acquiring evaluation preferences of decision makers is a key obstacle. To solve these problems, an innovative model for STROSP efficiency evaluation is developed. An indicator assessment system explicitly considers the key evaluation aspects, namely, service quantity, service quality, and service effect. This article combines fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and backpropagation (BP) neural network algorithm into an integrated model to quantify the efficiency of STROS. Prior knowledge of experts was fully utilized by FAHP. The neural network algorithm enabled the intelligent extraction and rapid inference of sample data features. The proposed model maximizes fuzzy mathematics in solving fuzzy and nonquantifiable problems and utilizes the advantages of the BP neural network on nonlinear mapping. The accuracy and reliability of the model are validated by a case study of six national STROSP in China. Estimation results demonstrate that the model is a powerful method for the real-time evaluation of STROS efficiency evaluation.},

  abstract={A complex disorder called ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is characterised by persistent problems with social communication, narrow interests, and repetitive behaviour. ASD sufferers may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in different ways from the average person. The majority of the time, their appearance does not set them apart from others. ASD sufferers may be highly talented in many different areas. For instance, some people with ASD may be highly communicative while others are nonverbal. While some people with ASD need significant daily support, others are able to live and work independently. Parents and caretakers can find early signs of this condition before a child becomes one year old. However, by the time the child is two or three years old, the symptoms are typically more severe. Here artificial intelligence techniques and data science techniques can be used. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting ASD from relevant observations in the patients. Differences in results between the two types of neural networks used have been shown as well.},

However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the network may cause learning complicated, poor generalization, overtraining and unstable. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this brief gives a constructive proof for the fact that a decay RBF neural network with n + 1 hidden neurons can interpolate n + 1 multivariate samples with zero error. Then we prove that the given decay RBFs can uniformly approximate any continuous multivariate functions with arbitrary precision without training. The faster convergence and better generalization performance than conventional RBF algorithm, BP algorithm, extreme learning machine and support vector machines are shown by means of two numerical experiments.},

  abstract={The shift from a linear economy to a closed-loop economy is a prominent topic in climate and environmental conservation. Applying the principles of circular economy in industry can significantly reduce the negative impact on the environment and increase the efficiency of using natural capital. However, the shift to this new economic paradigm encounters numerous obstacles, especially in the energy sector, which has many specific features. This study aims at identifying the main barriers to introduce both circular economy principles for traditional energy companies and the most promising ways to minimize them. A list of key barriers was identified, and a set of recommendations for implementing circular economy concepts at energy enterprises was proposed. Additionally, a circular economy framework adapted for traditional energy companies was designed#},

  abstract={The goal of circular economy is to save energy and reduce emissions. It is a new economic development mode of comprehensive development, full utilization of resources, waste reuse and energy-saving production. The development of circular economy needs to consider regional differences in economy, society, environment, resources, etc. This paper uses AHP-FCE method to build the evaluation index system of regional circular economy development, so as to measure the actual situation of regional circular economy development. On this basis, in order to predict the future development trend of circular economy based on historical evaluation index, we utilize the grey theory to build the prediction model. After inputting the original data into the model, we can get the forecast value of the circular economy development level of province A from 2022 to 2024. The prediction result shows that, although the growth rate of circular economy in A Province has basically stagnated from 2018 to 2021, it will enter the development stage in the next three years.},

  abstract={The maritime industry is intensively embracing green thinking. According to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Greenhouse Gas (GHG ) strategy, the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping should be reduced by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. Shipping adopts policies to comply with the set target, including ship redesign, structural retrofit, use of low-carbon material, and the installation of emission abatement technologies. All these approaches pave the way to circularity in the maritime economy, abandoning the linear model in vessel lifetime and adopting lean management, re-manufacturing, and re-usability of the asset. To this end, in the SmartShip project, we give prominence to data-driven ship monitoring by delivering an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) & Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled holistic cloud-based maritime performance and monitoring system. This system is considering the entire lifecycle of a ship, aiming to optimize energy efficiency, emissions reduction, fuel consumption, while, at the same time, include circular economy concepts in the maritime field. Our approach supports a cost-effective strategy where data analysis drives decisions in ship operation and maintenance.},

It pointed out that the balanced state of equilibrium could be promoted from second-best equilibrium to optimal equilibrium through active adjustment of government policies. The measures included strengthening environmental legislation to regulate the behavior of government, enterprises and the public; building policy support system to guide the behavior of market players and so on. In addition, improving of science, technology and market mechanism could spontaneously complete the circular economy system. Through the above measures, we could promote the establishment of circular economy system.},

This strength is seen as a solution to the set of problems encountered by uneducated companies, organizations, and humans concerning the environment, the economy, health, and the quality of the community. Although much had been said about the trend upward in population growth globally, and the projected excessive consumption is not in line with reality, it's necessary to improve the results. Whereby companies must be one of the first to foster strategies to mitigate adversity. In this sense, this study aims to research what are the main circular economy strategies developed in the field of civil engineering. To this extent, a systematic review of the literature was developed, taking the papers published in the last 11 years. In the results, it was possible to find waste management and demolition as one of the most represented strategies by the authors, followed by the management of sustainable materials. The results are important for the industrial sector and researchers and professionals interested in the applicability of circular economy in the labor market.},

  abstract={Coal-fired power plants are the main pollution source in most areas of China. The implementation of circular economy in coal-fired power plants is necessary for environmental protection and also an effective way of energy saving and emission reduction. In this paper, we make a survey on major studies of assessment methods and models for circular economy. The relative efficiency of circular economy for coal-fired power plants is evaluated with super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (SE-DEA) model, and the empirical study is carried out with field survey data. The result shows that the assessment model based on SE-DEA not only can be used to evaluate the relative efficiency of circular economy for the coal-fired power plant, but also may be applied to set the benchmark of circular economy implementation and to improve the circular economy performance for the power generation.},

  abstract={The circular economy (CE) model has been widely applied in large businesses, but very few research has been conducted on how CE may be applied in small- and medium-sized companies. Although emission of individual SMEs might not be comparable to that of LEs, the total emissions holistically have a significant impact due to large number of SMEs. Hence, the present paper aims at exploring barriers for CE transition in SMEs based on a systematic review of literature. 46 selected articles were screened according to eligibility criteria and then analyzed. According to the findings, the most frequently identified barriers are a inadequate financial resources, inadequate organizational capabilities, and a lack of regulation/standards. Potential paths for future research are also discussed.},

  abstract={It is well known that the dependability of equipment on a production site is strongly linked to the quality of maintenance operations. This paper explores the state of the art in obsolescence management during the crucial maintenance phase and in the context of circular economy principles. Through a systematic review of the literature, the study investigates strategies and methodologies employed to address equipment obsolescence while embracing principles of sustainability and resource efficiency. The research methodology involves defining and combining relevant keywords, utilizing research databases, and implementing filters to obtain a comprehensive selection of pertinent articles. Content analysis reveals insights into the distribution of articles across different categories and time periods, highlighting evolving scholarly interest in these topics. Various approaches to obsolescence management in maintenance are identified, including traditional replacement methods, remanufacturing, and system complexity reduction. Case studies provide practical insights into the application of these strategies, demonstrating their effectiveness in extending asset lifespans and optimizing maintenance practices. Furthermore, the integration of circular economy principles into maintenance strategies presents opportunities for enhancing sustainability and resource efficiency in asset management practices. The findings underscore the importance of continued research in this area to control costs and improve availability over the entire life cycle of equipment.},

  abstract={Circular economy has become a hot topic for scholars and practitioners as it represents a new industrial paradigm for waste generation, resource scarcity and sustainable economic growth that aims to overcome open systems paradigms, based on the traditional make, take, and disposal process. Whereas this issue has posed a lot of attention to the policies of circular economy as guidelines for policymakers, we still lack of consolidated managerial directions that support companies to implement this paradigm. In other words, although several scientific contributions started to shift the attention from macro (policies) to micro (company) levels of analysis, the issue of which managerial practices companies have to adopt for circular economy implementation still deserves particular attention. Although this literature gap continues persisting, several scholars have opened up the research stream of circular economy business models, which tries to analyze the business model design choices in the light of circular economy principles. Accordingly, we revise the main scientific contributions that analyze the managerial practices for circular economy business models. In doing so, we propose in a comprehensive theoretical framework a map of the managerial practices for circular economy business models that can be adopted at two different business model dimensions, i.e., the value network and the customer value proposition and interface. Therefore, we will test the suitability of our framework on a small medium Italian company operating in office supply industry for 23 years, by looking into the managerial practices that this company has implemented.},

  abstract={For enhanced education at the level of University courses such as those in biology or biotechnology, one of the key elements is the need of time and expertise to allow the student to familiarize laboratory techniques in par with regular theory. The Sakshat Amrita virtual biotechnology lab project focusing on virtualizing wet-lab techniques and integrating the learning experience has added a new dimension to the regular teaching courses at the University. Establishing virtual labs requires both domain knowledge and virtualizing skills via programming, animation and device-based feedback. Challenges in the biotechnology sector in setting up a laboratory that integrates both the feel and phenomenon includes the medley of multiple techniques. This paper reports one such cost-effective process used in virtualizing a real biotechnology lab at the University-level. The major challenge in setting up an effective knowledge dissemination for laboratory courses was not only the scientific approach of biotechnology, but included the virtualization aspects such as usage/design scalability, deliverability efficiency, network connectivity issues, security and speed of adaptability to incorporate and update changes into existing experiments. This paper also discusses an issue-specific case-study of a functional virtual lab in biotechnology and its many issues and challenges.},

  abstract={Biotechnology is defined as science that uses living organisms to enhance the human life and the environment. However, it's not a new science as many people think. The first Biotechnology product registered is the cheese, and since then it has been part of daily life. Likewise, there are many genes related with cancer that contain SNPs, which are the most common variation in the human genome. The SNPs are found in genes related to important functions such as metabolism. However, these variations can cause amino acid substitution, leading to a malformation in the second structure of the protein, affecting its functions and interactions. Biotechnology field has increased exponentially during the last years. With this the knowledge of medicine has expanded, as well. In Biotechnology is important the management of information and its organization for a correct investigation. This leads to the creation of data-base companies, which make easier the information management. In this research, Medical Decision Making and Biotechnology through science mapping have been analyzed using bibliometric tools, in order to explore the scientific productivity and compare important aspect to consider in scientific research. Furthermore, to understand its importance in Medical Decision Support Systems, Genetics and Reproduction, Drug Industry, and Clinical Practice and Research.},

  abstract={Investment in biotechnology start-ups has recently created `Virtual Biotechnology Start-up' model due to venture capital's reluctance and hardness for established pharmaceutical companies as licensees facing with patent cliff of blockbuster drugs and competition against generic drugs since Lehman Shock. VBS model is a call option because a predetermined pharmaceutical firm has an exclusive right to buy the start-up, if they succeeded in proof of concept. A research question is what the optimal irreversible timing is for biotechnology start-ups respectively to invest in R&D and then out-license forward established pharmaceutical firms in order to survive. Biotechnology start-up is defined as a portfolio of real options. Option-games approach is an integrated methodology between real options and game theory for the optimal trade-off between flexibility in irreversible investment under uncertainty and preemptive commitment in competitiveness. Treated is a continual-time duopolistic sequential-investment game model. An objective is to analyze the pioneer's maximum Net Present Value in monopolistic period between a biotechnology start-up's and a pharmaceutical firm's entrance thresholds into a market regarding demand index as a random variable. As conclusion findings, the cost advantage is a critical competitive factor even at higher volatility for a biotechnology start-up to expand the monopolistic period and NPV.},

  abstract={Biotechnology is the generic technology in the 21st century. It has a strategic importance for the development of companies, industries and nations in the near future. Therefore, many countries have been making a great effort to promote and develop biotechnology. U.S. has been the leading country in the world in promoting biotechnology. However, U.S. biotechnology policy are very diverse, so that there have been no comprehensive and systematic studies on it. In our paper, therefore, we will discuss the U.S. biotechnology policy in detail. For the effective analysis, we will rely on the concept of national innovation system, which emphasize the institutional settings of innovation actors and their interaction. This paper deals with U.S. national innovation system for biotechnology. We will analyze the role of major actors, academia, public research institutes, and industry and their interaction. According to our study, the U.S. biotechnological innovation system is composed of diverse actors and there are lots of start-up companies in biotechnology industry. In addition, there are many diverse policy programs for promoting biotechnology. In the analysis of U.S. biotechnological system and policy, we would like to maintain the Korean perspectives. Because of country-specific frame conditions, Korea and USA have different institutional settings and policies for promoting biotechnology. Therefore, our paper will render meaningful implications for Korea and USA. We also think that this paper will be of interest for international readers.},

Our longitudinal study on public dedicated Canadian Biotechnology firms (DBFs) (1990-2010), allows us to confirm all hypotheses with the exception of the fourth (support of venture capital). Overall, our results show that listed Canadian DBFs rely mainly on their human resources (Team management and star scientist) in order to survive.},

  abstract={Funding any business venture can be daunting, especially for entrepreneurs, who must sometimes raise millions of dollars from private investors to launch a new idea. Eric Migicovsky, CEO of Pebble Technology, found a way around this problem. When Migicovsky was unable to raise money from investors for his Pebble e-watch, a device with the ability to connect to Android and iPhone smartphones using Bluetooth technology, he took the idea to the crowdfunding Web site Kickstarter. By the time his company had closed its campaign, 70,000 people had contributed a whopping US$10.2 million to see his smartwatch realized. Migicovsky is not the only one to enjoy wild success by turning to the masses for money. At the time of this writing, the makers of the Star Citizen video game surpassed Pebble Technology by raising more than US$2.1 million in funding on Kickstarter and more than US$15 million on its own site using the WordPress crowdfunding plug-in called IgnitionDeck. The game is planned for release in ?December 2014.},

  pages={1207-1217},
  abstract={Biotechnology will play a vital role in the overall technological development of the 21st century. Given the rapid speed of globalization coupled with the continuous development of communication technology, small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a variety of high-tech industries in many countries, such as the agriculture biotechnology (agri-biotech) industry in Taiwan, now have a clear path to internationalization. This work is a preliminary attempt to identify key drivers and their relationships in order for Taiwanese agri-biotech SMEs to better understand their internationalization prospects. To do so, the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical basis to, first specify the key drivers, and second to assess the factors that compose the value of internationalization. This study utilized a survey approach to collect data from Taiwanese agri-biotech SMEs. To test hypothesized relationships a Partial Least Squaring (PLS) tool was employed. The results of the analyzed data show that organizational factors have the biggest impact on the value of internationalization, followed by technology, and environmental factors which surprisingly had an insignificant influence. These results indicate that by placing a priority on having a Global Scope, developing adequate Financial Resources, and improving Marketing Capability SMEs can improve their readiness for internationalization. This study contributes in a more practical sense to an understanding by SMEs of where their efforts should be put in order to be more effective in their international endeavors, and to the government in developing policies that promote the organizational growth and development of its agri-biotech SMEs.},

  abstract={Virtual laboratories are ICT tools that are becoming more prevalent in classroom education complementing the lack of resources or tutors while enabling anytime-anywhere student participation scenarios. Specifically disciplines such as biotechnology, which are interaction rich, have seen several types of virtual labs. In this paper, we explore an analysis of student feedback post virtual labs sessions suggesting virtual labs improve teaching and learning experiences via user-interactions. Feedback was collected from undergraduate and postgraduate level students belonging to biotechnology programs. We look at two objectives namely perceived usefulness and the role of interactions on the virtual platform and simulators, in addition to animations. Most data were collected using direct approach via organized workshops. This approach allowed us to extract useful information without concerns of sparseness and unsolicited data compared to remote feedback. Our studies on feedback analysis indicate that student users interpret results in animation based virtual labs. However, a larger percentage of users suggest student usage and performance improved only with interactive simulators rather than animations. Although further tests are being performed, our preliminary studies on 200 participants suggest novel virtual labs models must include a simulation or emulations of lab environment in order to enhance student laboratory skills.},

In this paper, we explore the role of biotechnology remotely controlled labs in augmenting student education via allowing real time shared resources. We deployed 23 virtual laboratories with 218 virtual experiments in biotechnology to provide an online laboratory experience that allowed students and teachers to share and augment conceptual and practical knowledge. Student users reported high usability and repeatability of experimental process and suggested virtual labs as complementing tool for augmenting student's perception in an active learning scenario. Hybrid approaches in mobile learning indicated student users preferred a blended learning role via classrooms. We also observed that performance in examinations improved with those students using remote labs. We also evaluated the role of virtual labs as a teaching tool for university teachers.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on “senior-star” biotech firms as the study target instead of the recently designed NASDAQ Junior Biotechnology Index. We are more interested in the limited number of top-performing “star” players in “senior” biotech firms rather than the much younger and promising next-generation firms. In the market capitalization, these senior biotech firms comprise the top-tier elite class in the head part of the Zipf distribution. Some senior negative-profit (N.P.) biotech firms are willing to increase the deficits for more active investment in research and development (R&D). According to the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis applied to the FY2020 US Securities and Exchange Commission dataset of the electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval system, the R&D productivity of the N.P. Biotech firms are higher than their positive-profit counterparts. Thus, for senior-star biotech firms to overcome the valley of death, R&D investment can be considered a call option in real options by regarding the cash-on-hand as an underlying asset and the deficit as a strike price.},

  abstract={Virtual labs are popularized as a visual education tool that offers diverse analysis of experiments through different components like graphics mediated animations, mathematically modeled simulations, user-interactive emulations, remote-triggered experiments and the use of augmented perception haptic devices. With the advances in ICT-based education, virtual labs have become a novel platform that helps users to engage in their proactive learning process. Our goal was to analyze the effective role of biotechnology virtual labs in improving academic performance of students and complementing classroom education. We tested the adaptability, perceived usefulness and ease of use of biotechnology virtual labs on different user groups in sciences and engineering. This study focuses mainly on the student and teacher groups from different universities across India. Feedback data was collected via a direct approach using organized workshops conducted in the year 2014-2015. 85% of participants suggested perceived usefulness of biotechnology virtual labs helped them to improve their academic performance compared to a traditional classroom scenario. Most users indicated the learning materials provided by virtual lab system were easy to understand, thus suggesting the better adaptability of ICT-enabled techniques amongst different users. This augments the role of virtual labs for remote learners all over the world. For India, such learning methods have helped overcome limitations seen in classroom-based education such as equipment accessibility, location and other economic issues. Through these studies, we construe the usage of virtual labs as a next-gen interactive textbook and as a media-rich learning source of distance and blended education.},

This article speculated whether the portfolio of biotech owned stocks and bitcoin can cope with these uncertainties. At the same time, investors need to pay attention to the companies that are studying the COVID-19 vaccine and whether they have state financial support. Also, Python and Excel were used to explore the daily return, annual volatility, and portfolio performance of biotechnology stocks. Besides, a multiple linear regression model on CPI and GDP focusing on whether macroeconomic factors affect bitcoin was established. These results support the conclusion that currently adding biotech supported by the federal government and bitcoin into the portfolio could respond to the risks from COVID-19.},

Traditional infectious disease monitoring methods often rely on manual collection and analysis of data, which is inefficient and easily limited by human errors. However, the development of artificial intelligence and big data technology has provided new opportunities for infectious disease prevention and control. This article introduces the application of artificial intelligence in infectious disease monitoring. By using artificial intelligence algorithms and models, real-time monitoring and analysis of infectious disease data can be carried out, predicting the spread trend and risk of infectious diseases. This helps to detect and report infectious disease outbreaks, thus taking corresponding prevention and control measures and reducing the spread and impact of the epidemic. At the same time, this article explores the application of big data in infectious disease prevention and control. By using big data technology, in-depth mining and analysis of patient case data, virus gene sequences, transmission chain information, and other data can be carried out to discover the characteristics and patterns of infectious diseases, and be used to build an infectious disease warning system to predict and prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases in advance. Finally, this article discusses the application cases of artificial intelligence and big data in infectious disease prevention and control. By combining artificial intelligence and big data technology, the entire process of monitoring and management of infectious diseases can be achieved.},

Currently, under the impact of artificial intelligence, college students are facing risks such as weakening their dominant position, obliterating value consensus, and reducing innovative thinking during their growth. The main reasons for these risks are insufficient teacher guidance, technical limitations, and insufficient government investment. In the future, we can explore Countermeasures based on the three major factors in education: educators, educational objects, and educational intermediaries, in order to better build an intelligent education ecosystem and cultivate creative talents required for the new era.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence has developed rapidly in recent years, which not only brings convenience to people’s lives, but also plays an important role in education. In the past, teachers mainly relied on relevant teaching materials to prepare lessons, but now teachers can use artificial intelligence technology to prepare lessons, which reduces the burden of preparing lessons for teachers. Artificial intelligence, referred to as AI for short, is a branch of computer science, and it is a discipline that studies how to make computers simulate people’s thinking and intelligent behavior. The application of artificial intelligence in education can promote education equality and improve teaching efficiency. For example, in some remote mountain schools, educational resources are scarce. The application of artificial intelligence can integrate and share educational resources to the network platform to achieve education equality. Then, this paper analyzes and explores how to change the teaching methods in the future. Starting from the current situation of the development of artificial intelligence in China and combining with the current teaching, it continuously analyzes and studies the teaching methods incorporating artificial intelligence to promote the systematic reform and development of future teaching.},

  abstract={Complex systems design and its design management are very difficult though there are lot of developments and research in the fields of systems engineering, and complex systems science. Although various authors have proposed approaches to deal with complex systems design and its management, what is missing is the holistic approach considering human centeredness of various stakeholders, their understanding and acting systemically. Currently, there is lack of a conceptual design and design management framework leveraging design thinking and systems thinking that take human-centeredness, understanding and acting of various stakeholders systemically into consideration. The aim of this paper is to explore the area of complex systems, design, its design management and their problems and how can design thinking and systems thinking be leveraged to overcome the problems of complex system design, its design management and to propose a conceptual framework. We found that there is a reciprocal influencing relationship between design thinking and systems thinking that will be beneficial to complex systems design and its management, especially in dealing the complex coercive relationships amongst stakeholders. The proposed conceptual complex system design and its management framework will be useful for complex system designers and complex system design managers in order to effectively manage the challenges of complex system design and its management problems in a complex dynamic environment.},

However, these chaotic systems with synchronous schemes are mostly of the same dimension and do not contain time-delay. However, time-delay is very common in life. By constructing suitable complex Lyapunov function and adaptive complex update laws, the sufficient conditions for GCMHFPS implementation are given, and the corresponding calculation formula is given, and new estimate of unknown complex parameters are given. The feasibility of the scheme is verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract={Adaptive behaviours of nodes can cause the evolution of networks. To investigate the characteristics of evolutionary complex networks that result from the interactions between agents in complex adaptive systems, we construct a complex network model of heat-bug interactions by drawing on statistical physics methods based on the heat-bug experiment. The networks of interactions between heat bugs show the following: that the degree distribution evolves from the Gamma distribution to the Gaussian distribution, that the average local density is high, and the average path length is short, and that the dynamics of clusters in the networks changes from creation to combination and then to separation, and the members of the clusters change continuously, but the number of clusters remains stable. Based on the micro perspective, these results provide a good alternative to explain emerging complex phenomena by elucidating the characteristics of evolutionary complex networks.},

  abstract={The Department of Defense, like other government agencies and indeed the global business community, faces increasingly complex challenges that cannot be met by stand-alone systems. This has led to growing reliance on increasingly interoperable and interdependent systems that combine multiple organizational and functional capabilities to achieve and overarching mission. This is the motivation for developing systems- of-systems, enterprise systems, and even extended enterprise systems. This paper focuses on the engineering of this class of systems: a process that demands consideration of increasing scale, the rapid pace of change of the underlying technologies, the complexity of system interactions, and, perhaps most important, shared ownership and control. We hypothesize that engineering these systems is inherently different from engineering large-scale but essentially deterministic systems. Decisions about the system(s) under development have to consider not only the technical and programmatic dimensions but also the political, operational and economic contexts. This paper presents a diagnostic tool for profiling complexity and uncertainty in large scale system engineering developments and provides some lessons learned from its application. On the basis of these insights, we propose an approach to tailoring engineering and acquisition strategies and practices to the specific circumstances at hand.},

This is largely due to the integration of complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration. The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks. The additional problem of obscurity has resulted in increasing concealing of unauthorized access, identity thefts, privacy and security breaches of highly sensitive data, interception through the man-in-the-middle and intermediary systems. The paper examines the effectiveness, resiliency, robustness, scalability and adaptability in the design, safety, security and usability of engineering complex integrated systems and network systems for complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration and security.},

  abstract={Architectural complexity analysis plays an important role in the design of complex systems and System of Systems (SoS). In this process, a central problem is how to define the complexity indicator in the SoS level. This paper discusses a preliminary study on the architectural complexity analysis of the BRIDGE system, a typical large-scale emergency rescue management system. The traditional definition of architectural complexity, which has been successfully used to describe the architectural complexity of military SoS, is not suited for this case. The definition of architectural complexity, which consists of the multiplication of several components of complexity indicators, does not consider the varying importance of each component in different types of complex systems and SoS. This paper proposes a more general definition of architectural complexity by introducing additional exponential weighting factors to model such domain-related effects. Expert ratings on the relative importance of pair-wise components to the architectural complexity are used to estimate these weights. The new definition of architectural complexity facilitates the incorporation of the subjective domain-related knowledge and thereby provides a more flexible and reasonable measurement on the architectural complexity of complex systems and SoS.},

  abstract={Software testing costs would be reduced if we could find which classes or models of software are more complex and thus more likely to have defects. This paper defines a method which uses the software complexity measurement from complex network method to allocate resources in complex software system for gray-box testing. It presents the way of mapping the software codes to complex network and some metric's effects in software network, such as degree and degree of ripple. By using these metrics, it defines the complexity measurement to complex software network. The work about C++ complex software system shows how to use this method.},

  abstract={The systems perspective has been established as a means to structure and understand complex phenomenon. Current approaches are premised on defining and establishing a hierarchical (reductionist) structure that, in effect represents a complex system as a system of systems. The underlying assumption of reductionism is that the resultant component behaviour and dynamics represent the overall system behaviour. In reality, most complex systems and management approaches are highly interconnected, dynamic and subject to non-linear behaviour. As such, they defy any rational description in terms of overall behaviour and effectiveness as prescribed through reductionism. This paper considers the management of major projects as a complex of systems and discusses the nature, characteristics and properties that lead to the difficulties associated with reductionism. The need for systems science, or synthesis, approaches is briefly discussed as an effective means to addressing the situation.},

  abstract={The analysis of blackouts, which can inevitably lead to catastrophic damage to power grids, helps to explore the nature of complex power grids but becomes difficult using conventional methods. This brief studies the vulnerability analysis and recognition of key nodes in power grids from a complex network perspective. Based on the ac power flow model and the network topology weighted with admittance, the cascading failure model is established first. The node electrical centrality is further pointed out, using complex network centrality theory, to identify the key nodes in power grids. To effectively analyze the behavior and verify the correctness of node electrical centrality, the net-ability and vulnerability index are introduced to describe the transfer ability and performance under normal operation and assess the vulnerability of the power system under cascading failures, respectively. Simulation results of IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test cases show that the key nodes can be effectively identified with high electrical centrality, the resultant cascading failures that eventually lead to a severe decrease in net-ability, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of the analysis.},

Though, it is also dedicated to explore the issues of integrated control and supervision within their possible interplay over complex plant processes. The justification for continuing the adventure of investigating controlled complex systems from a standpoint of physics and not solely mathematics is found to emerge by itself inevitably. It has been found, the cybernetic physics of complex networks and systems as well as their feasible controls is an open exploration road towards many unknowns. The analysis framework is based on the set-theoretic approach to systems science from the perspective of Lyapunov stability theory being employed.},

  abstract={The research on complex systems is different from that on general systems because the former must consider self-organization, emergence, uncertainty, predetermination, and evolution. As an important method to transform the world, a simulation is one of the most important skills to discover complex systems. In this study, we provide a survey on complex systems and their simulation methods. Initially, the development history of complex system research is summarized from two main lines. Then, the eight common characteristics of the most complex systems are presented. Furthermore, the simulation methods of complex systems are introduced in detail from four aspects, namely, meta-synthesis methods, complex networks, intelligent technologies, and other methods. From the overall point of view, intelligent technologies are the driving force, and complex networks are the advanced structure. Meta-synthesis methods are the integration strategy, and other methods are the supplements. In addition, we show three complex system simulation examples: digital reactor simulation, simulation of a logistics system in the industrial site, and crowd evacuation simulation. The examples show that a simulation is a useful means and an important method in complex system research. Finally, the future development prospects for complex systems and their simulation methods are suggested.},

  abstract={Complex systems are composed of many heterogeneous subsystems and components, which contribute to system failure or degradation. Reliability analysis of complex systems has slowly gained attention, yet most research continues to focus on the degradation of components in complex systems, including multiple failure modes, propagation of failure modes, and uncertainty analysis. Achieving and preserving reliable operation of complex systems requires more complete architectural models, which can utilize the information on the components and interactions between subsystems and their components. To address this limitation, this paper presents a method to conduct network reliability analysis of complex systems. The approach employs complex network theory, including several parameters related to network properties. A network reliability analysis method is subsequently defined and a performance index specified. A case study illustrates the proposed method, interpreting results and identifying opportunities for future elaboration of the model. Our results indicate that the proposed method can evaluate the overall reliability and identify the weak modules and links of a complex system that should be targeted for improvement.},

  abstract={The relationship between components in modern complex systems is becoming more and more complex. The local disturbance in the system may cause global impact due to fault correlation. In view of this, the traditional safety model cannot be described comprehensively and objectively, and the model has some problems, such as inconsistency with the design model, poor objectivity, and difficulty in ensuring completeness. Based on the multi-view modeling framework of DoDAF, the Sys-DoD model focus on safety is established by using SysML. The model can describe the causal logic and propagation relationship between the components of complex system in the same and different hierarchies, and provide a complete and accurate model support for subsequent safety analysis and risk assessment.},

  abstract={The properties of distributed computing and communication systems are critical factors for the effective management of distributed complex systems within the network-centric approach. In different sources, devoted to the construction of computing and communication systems, it is emphasized that the quality of hardware and software complexes (network nodes), is determined by the quality of project management of its creation, one of the components of this is functional safety. The author emphasizes the uniqueness of projects, the distinctive features of software systems from complex systems of a different nature, which results in the specifics of project management for the creation of hardware and software complexes. The conceptual basis of this work is the well-known principle of complementarity by N. Bohr. This is expressed in the fact that the focus of the study is the generality of problem situations that occur in the managing of complex systems of different nature. Formal models of problem situations are system archetypes. The structures of architectures corresponding to the reactive and proactive strategies for ensuring the functional safety of hardware and software complexes are proposed. It is shown that the structures of architectures serve as the basis for the identification of system archetypes. This, in turn, creates the basis for the adaptation of algorithmic and parametric models developed for the study of complex systems of a different nature in the field of functional safety of components of computing and communication systems.},

  abstract={The fragility created by hierarchical organizational constructs crosses over into the design of many large scale IT systems that are distributed across an enterprise. This means, that for these systems, end-to-end system design comes from the top down, creating a situation in which all fragility rises up to the largest scales of the system; this is a result of these systems being centrally controlled, often at the top of a hierarchy. In order for enterprise systems such as these to augment or repair themselves, they must undergo a catastrophic, enterprise-wide failure and be reengineered, once again by top-down direction [1]. This is the opposite of resilient system design and represents a situation where federal IT can be very inefficient. The current climate in the US of proactive and aggressive infrastructure consolidation via the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) only serves to further incentivize system designers to construct extremely fragile systems at both the application and infrastructure layers. This fragility puts these systems at greater risk for enterprise failure. An example of a critical federal enterprise IT system's design and resulting fragility when perturbed (i.e., via consolidation and modernization) will be examined in this paper. Engineering guidelines from a complex systems perspective will be recommended to counter this resulting fragility. These guidelines will be from both an IT and government policy point of view and are generalized for applicability to systems engineering outside the scope of just IT systems.},

  abstract={Childhood mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD are commonly-occurring and often go undetected into adolescence or adulthood. This can lead to detrimental impacts on long-term wellbeing and quality of life. Current parent-report assessments for pre-school aged children are often biased, and thus increase the need for objective mental health screening tools. Leveraging digital tools to identify the behavioral signature of childhood mental disorders may enable increased intervention at the time with the highest chance of long-term impact. We present data from 84 participants (4-8 years old, 50% diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and/or ADHD) collected during a battery of mood induction tasks using the ChAMP System. Unsupervised Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) constructed from movement and audio features indicate that age did not tend to explain clusters as consistently as gender within task-specific and cross-task SOMs. Symptom prevalence and diagnostic status also showed some evidence of clustering. Case studies suggest that high impairment (>80th percentile symptom counts) and diagnostic subtypes (ADHD-Combined) may account for most behaviorally distinct children. Based on this same dataset, we also present results from supervised modeling for the binary classification of diagnoses. Our top performing models yield moderate but promising results (ROC AUC .6-.82, TPR .36-.71, Accuracy .62-.86) on par with our previous efforts for isolated behavioral tasks. Enhancing features, tuning model parameters, and incorporating additional wearable sensor data will continue to enable the rapid progression towards the discovery of digital phenotypes of childhood mental health.Clinical Relevance— This work advances the use of wearables for detecting childhood mental health disorders.},

  pages={5588-5598},
  abstract={Depression is a common mental health condition that often occurs in association with other chronic illnesses, and varies considerably in severity. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich information about a patient's medical history and can be used to train, test and maintain predictive models to support and improve patient care. This work evaluated the feasibility of implementing an environment for predicting mental health crisis among people living with depression based on both structured and unstructured EHRs. A large EHR from a mental health provider, Mersey Care, was pseudonymised and ingested into the Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform CogStack, allowing text content in binary clinical notes to be extracted. All unstructured clinical notes and summaries were semantically annotated by MedCAT and BioYODIE NLP services. Cases of crisis in patients with depression were then identified. Random forest models, gradient boosting trees, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, with varying feature arrangement, were trained to predict the occurrence of crisis. The results showed that all the prediction models can use a combination of structured and unstructured EHR information to predict crisis in patients with depression with good and useful accuracy. The LSTM network that was trained on a modified dataset with only 1000 most-important features from the random forest model with temporality showed the best performance with a mean AUC of 0.901 and a standard deviation of 0.006 using a training dataset and a mean AUC of 0.810 and 0.01 using a hold-out test dataset. Comparing the results from the technical evaluation with the views of psychiatrists shows that there are now opportunities to refine and integrate such prediction models into pragmatic point-of-care clinical decision support tools for supporting mental healthcare delivery.},

  abstract={Nowadays the human-being is suffering from many issues in the society. In the current situation mental health problem is a prevalence issue. Usage of sensor data and dataset is an interesting issue dealing with prediction of mental health of the people living in society. The data science process can be carried out by collecting datasets from various health sector domains and differentiated into three categories such as low, medium, high. This is helpful in detecting weather the person is suffering from any mental issue or not. A sample test is conducted to assess the health conditions of healthy groups and people having mental illness with the help of data mining in data science field. This paper explains about a novel framework for prediction of public mental health condition which are helpful to handle the challenges in the field of data science. Evaluation of data science surveys is different from traditional data analysis due to the scientific approach method used during data classification and filtration. Here the role of "Data Science" framework is for promoting the usage of framework by the healthcare professionals to face challenges of mental health.},

  abstract={Mental health disorders in children and adolescents are increasingly problematic, necessitating the development of effective early detection tools due to their impact on long-term individual and societal health. Previous research has applied machine learning (ML) techniques to detect stress through physiological data and social media sentiment analysis, yet its use in direct assessment of children's mental health is scant. This study introduces a novel method by analyzing data from 2,600 elementary students gathered by the Healthier Kids Foundation regarding their mental health. We developed and evaluated three ML models, including a multi-tier approach, to identify students needing further mental health interventions, with assessments verified by human clinicians. These models achieved a maximum accuracy of 94.5% in four mental health categories. The results underscore the potential of ML in enhancing diagnostic and intervention strategies in children's mental health services, offering significant benefits by potentially reducing the health burden faced by children and adolescents with untreated mental health conditions. This research not only advances ML applications in child mental health assessment but also provides actionable insights for healthcare providers to integrate these technologies into practice.},

  abstract={Originally developed for aerospace engineering, the Kalman Filter, a mathematical algorithm, has proven to have a novel application in mental health, providing a potential instrument for prediction, monitoring, and personalized treatment of mental health conditions. This paper investigates the theoretical underpinning of the Kalman Filter comparing its application in dynamic systems with the intricate, changing nature of mental health. We analyze the potential of the Kalman Filter to transform mental health care by supplying a quantitative, model-based way of comprehending the complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors that determine an individual's mental condition. The Kalman Filter holding promise for mental health interventions to be made more efficient and responsive is illustrated by mood prediction and monitoring, personalized treatment, and cognitive behavioral modification applications. Yet, the issues connected with data confidentiality, the difficulty in human behavior modeling, and the link between qualitative and quantitative data are also considered. The paper ends by covering future perspectives that among other things stress further research aimed at fine-tuning the algorithm's applicability in mental health care and providing a grounding for insights into its possibility to contribute to a more adaptive, personalized and efficient approach to treatment. This investigation at the crossroads of the advanced math theory and mental health care demonstrates the innovative use of the Kalman Filter and provides a promising direction for the future research and practical application in this area.},

  abstract={Research demonstrates a growing mental health crisis in graduate education, which can contribute to productivity, departure, and well-being issues. To address this crisis and advocate for systemic change, this project explored faculty perceptions about graduate student mental health and how these perceptions intersect with direct action when student mental health challenges arise. We were guided by phenomenological inquiry to explore how faculty attitudes (n = 3) about mental health shape programmatic and individual decisions around supporting mental health. We thematically analyzed interviews discussing stress and mental health focused on faculty experiences. Faculty interviews demonstrated varying attitudes toward graduate student stress and mental health. Faculty desires to engage in discussions about stress or mental health were on a wide spectrum, often with work productivity guiding these discussions. Further, faculty highlighted levels of discomfort with engaging in discussions about mental health, especially with the students they work closest with. Findings indicate a need to foster faculty skill and comfort with engaging with students about their mental health while also providing clear institutional policies that support these actions to address the mental health crisis.},

  abstract={Next Step Clinic (NSC) is a neighborhood-based mental clinic in Milwaukee in the USA for early identification and intervention of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. NSC's primary goal is to serve the underserved families in that area with children aged 15 months to 10 years who have ASD symptoms free of cost. Our proposed and implemented Electronic Medical Records (NSC: EMR) has been developed for NSC. This paper describes the NSC: EMR's design specification and whole development process with the workflow control of this system in NSC. This NSC: EMR has been used to record the patient’s medical data and make appointments both physically or virtually. The integration of standardized psychological evaluation form has reduced the paperwork and physical storage burden for the family navigator. By deploying the system, the family navigator can increase their productivity from the screening to all intervention processes to deal with ASD children. Even in the lockdown time, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, about 84 ASD patients from the deprived family at that area got registered and took intervention through this NSC: EMR. The usability and cost-effective feature has already shown the potential of NSC: EMR, and it will be scaled to serve a large population in the USA and beyond.},

  abstract={In today's diversified and rapidly developing society, whether it is the living environment, learning environment, making friends environment, or the environment for further education and employment, it all puts great pressure on people. However, existing mental health assessment systems only use professional language to describe users' evaluation results, which brings great inconvenience to users' understanding and analysis of evaluation results. As a result, users cannot timely know their mental health status and cannot detect their mental health problems. Therefore, in response to the problems in the current mental health assessment system and how to better assist individuals in analyzing their own mental health status, this article proposed a mental health assessment method based on fuzzy evaluation technology. Finally, this article also analyzed the psychological status of 2022 college students through a fuzzy evaluation system for mental health assessment. From the results of some students' mental health tests, it can be seen that two students have moderate and mild abnormalities in their psychological conditions. By examining the comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the two students' psychological conditions, it can be concluded that they have higher scores in depression and interpersonal sensitivity. Therefore, in subsequent psychological health interventions, it is necessary to focus on providing assistance to students from these two aspects.},

  abstract={Many people experienced an increase in mental health distress due to the isolation requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and the resulting isolation protocols to control the spread of the virus no doubt, sparked researchers' interest in seeking solutions to address the impact on people's mental health in different situations. One of such solutions is the use of technologies to cope with mental health challenges. Though a plethora of technology exists for communication and socialization with several others proposed to deal with mental health breakdown during the pandemic, there is no ‘one-size fits all’ technology that has been identified to address every individual's distress level and coping strategy. This study thus, examines the existing technologies that have been used by people to manage their mental health distress, and proposes a sociotechnical model that can be used to identify current technologies and the effectiveness of such technologies in addressing an individual's mental health distress and symptoms.},

  abstract={This work in progress research paper characterizes mental wellness in engineering at five institutions across the Western United States to better understand what mental health issues most affect the broader engineering student community. Anecdotal evidence has long suggested that stress and certain mental wellness issues are particularly acute in the field of Engineering, and some recent research has shown elevated rates of mental wellness issues at different institutions around the country. This paper presents the results of a previously validated mental health survey conducted with first- and second-year students at several universities. The results of this work include screening rates for major mental health issues (e.g. DSM diagnosable) and moderate mental health issues as captured by the Kessler 6 screening instrument; screening rates for depressive, anxiety, and eating disorders as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ); and screening rates for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured by the Primary-Care Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PC-PTSD) instrument. This work also includes a preliminary analysis of screen rates by demographic groups so that educators and academic facilitators may be better aware of the types of challenges that face a diverse engineering student populace. Overall, we find that 28.4% percent of respondents potentially suffer from a diagnosable mental health condition as measured by Kessler 6. We also find that an additional 55.2% of students screen positive for moderate psychological distress. Breaking measurements down by demographic groups, we find that female respondents, particularly those from historically excluded ethnic groups and races, show elevated rates of Panic and PTSD disorders when compared to the male population.},

  abstract={This study takes college students' mental health as the research object, combined with big data technology, and uses association rule mining algorithm Apriori to deeply understand the characteristics and trends of students' mental health. A large scale mental health data was collected through the psychological evaluation system, and a psychological association analysis system was constructed. This paper uses data mining technology to identify the correlation rule in the field of college students' mental health, and establishes the mental health risk prediction model by applying the association rule weight. The results showed the correlation between learning time, social activities and sleep time, and established the corresponding model for risk prediction. Scientific support for personalized interventions and prevention measures, as well as new perspectives and tools for the study and prediction of mental health problems, underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in the field of student mental health.},

  abstract={In remote mental healthcare systems, formal evaluation and clinical assessment of common mental health disorders such as anxiety, post traumatic stress, depression, etc. is significantly difficult because the severity of their indicative symptoms cannot be easily assessed or quantified. However, over the last decade, various clinical Mental Health Indices have been proposed and used by various health organizations and medical professional communities to detect or assess severity of multiple disorders. In this paper, we propose and design a formal methodology for evaluating the correlation and corroboration between three indices, viz. MHI-5, WHO-5 and PHQ-9 for preemptive flagging of mental health issues in university students. In a participatory retrospective study of 235 students driven by ecological momentary assessments, we were able to quantify question-wise correlation between indices, assess student perception of personal mental health, and draw comparisons between index scores and official diagnosis of mental health disorders. Through this work, we make a case for continuous assessment and progress-tracking of mental health history using the MHIs for assisting campus counsellors, psychologists and other stakeholders in student welfare.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of social economy, the opportunities and challenges faced by contemporary college students are complex, and their mental health is also under the impact of many aspects. The traditional offline one-to-one mental health guidance can not meet the current needs of vocational college students for mental health. This paper tries to build a mental health education mode of vocational school students from the 6 aspects of mental health screening, student real-time online health service platform, home school cooperative service network system and strengthening psychological curriculum construction.},

  abstract={The end of 2019 and the whole of 2020 were marked by the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Harsh epidemiological measures began to be applied, which led to the restriction of social contacts, and everything began to be done remotely or online. All these measures have led to the appearance of anxiety and depressive symptoms in some people. The pandemic has changed our way of life and is considered a global stressor. In 2020, Croatia was also hit by two strong devastating earthquakes, leading to anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals, but sometimes also to PTSD in those who have suffered more severe consequences. Nowadays, almost everyone uses smartphone and many mobile applications are available (especially if they are free) that are used to improve mental health. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on mobile applications that have been used so far to improve mental health and to describe some of the advantages and disadvantages of them. The role of mental health professionals in the development of mental health mobile applications is highlighted, as well as the possibility of availability of mental health professionals in the daily use of such mobile applications (in the form of coaching). Finally, it can be concluded that a number of mobile applications are being developed that could be useful, both in acute stress and in chronic coping with anxiety and stress.},
